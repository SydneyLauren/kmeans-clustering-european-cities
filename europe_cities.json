I recommend taking a walk around the inner Alster lake starting here, then passing luxury hotels as you head in the direction of the Kennedy bridge, from where you can enjoy a fantastic panorama view of Hamburg city centre.Just a short walk from Jungfernstieg is the urban oasis \"Planten und Blomen,\" a park with many green areas, and various types of flowers and trees, as well as lakes and a tropical garden. In winter you can go ice-skating here, but the park is at its best in summer, when the flowerbeds are in bloom, and you can simply relax on the grass. You'll soon forget you're in a city with 1.7 million inhabitants!Love it or hate it, Hamburg's garish Reeperbahn -- the red light district -- is an iconic neighbourhood, and worth passing through if only to experience the amusing, neon-lit underbelly of the city. You'll find all types of bars, clubs and clientele here, if you decide to stop and people-watch for a while.You'll find plenty of food and plenty of noise at the Hamburger Fischmarkt, which today sells much more than fish, as its name would suggest. Nowadays you can buy everything from large baskets of fruit and veg to noodles -- and of course, fish -- here and sample plenty of produce while you browse. Just be prepared to rise at the crack of dawn!We Hamburg locals fondly refer to the main protestant church of Stankt Mechaeliskirche (St. Michael's Church) simply as \"Michel.\" With a clock tower that stands 132 metres tall, offering stunning panoramic views of the city, it's little surprise that this building is an iconic Hamburg landmark and incredibly popular with tour buses. The area surrounding it is also worth exploring: Though a little hidden by this dominating structure, the cute group of Krameramtswohnungen (17th century timber houses, built to house Trader's Guild widows) situated here have been converted into a small art gallery and restaurant.Beautiful mansions line the banks of the outer Alster lake, and the best way to get a closer peek is to rent a canoe or paddleboat and head out onto the water. Once you've explored the lake's many beautiful small canals, head back to dry land and walk or cycle around the shore."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "58044c64fc346a8631fa4bcb"}, "Vienna, Austria ": "\nIn Vienna, the coffee house isn\u2019t just a hangout: it\u2019s an institution. Lingering over a newspaper with a pastry and a strong espresso drink is, according to UNESCO, officially a Viennese cultural pastime. Walk off your slice of Sachertorte with a self-guided tour of the city\u2019s stunning traditional, Secessionist, and modern architecture, such as the Imperial Palace, the State Opera House, the Kirche am Steinhof, or the Kunsthistorisches Museum, an exercise in ornate geometry.\nVienna's state boulevard girds the city center and is the perfect place to orient yourself. It stands in the place of the former city walls, which were torn down after the Napoleonic Wars. Take the Yellow Ring Tram for a 30-minute tour past beautiful buildings such as state museums, the Opera, Austrian Parliament, Vienna City Hall, and Stadtpark.Vienna's luxury shopping mile is part of the pedestrian area in the center, running between the State Opera and St. Stephen's Cathedral. The most famous shops are Oesterreichische Werkstaetten and glass manufacturer Lobmeyr Swarovski's stunning flagship store. However, Kaerntnerstrasse is better for window shopping than souvenir shopping.Winterpalais is a hidden gem of a town palace, and many travelers discover it by chance. It's located just off Kaerntnerstrasse and has only 10 rooms, so it won't overwhelm you on your first day. The palace once belonged to Prince Eugene of Savoy, one of Austria's most famous military commanders.Situated on the outskirts of Vienna, the historic tavern Zu den drei Hacken (To the Three Axes) provides a rustic break from Kaerntnerstrasse. The place is well known, busy, and a great introduction to classic Viennese cuisine \u2014 from schnitzel (breaded meat) to schweinsbraten (roast pork loin) and knoedel (dumplings).Situated on Ringstrasse, the Museum of Applied Arts displays a wide array of Viennese arts and crafts, from 14th-century stained glass to 1950s figurines. Highlights include an excellent collection of Biedermeier sofas and Thonet chairs.If people ask me for a great insider place to have Austrian food, I often recommend Restaurant Silberwirt, for a variety of reasons. First, the menu covers the best of Austrian delicacies, including contemporary favorites. Second, the building complex, Schlossquadrat, dates from the 14th century and is a historic gem with a romantic courtyard. Finally, it's located off the beaten path in the trendy district of Margareten, popular with urban professionals and young families alike.For six centuries, Vienna was the capital of the mighty Austro-Hungarian Empire, ruled by Habsburg dynasty. The Hofburg, home of the Habsburgs from the first emperor in 1273 until the last in 1918, grew in scope and grandeur over the years, as each emperor sought to outdo his predecessors. Today, it houses a cornucopia of attractions, including six museums, the National Library, and the Imperial Apartments. To get a feel for this place that was at the center of European history for hundreds of years, start in the middle and work your way out.After so much pomp, treat yourself to a down-to-earth meal of Vienna sausage at a traditional Wurstelstand (sausage stand). Bitzinger's is located near the State Opera and serves up tasty treats. The sausages are cut up and served with mustard and a roll or a slice of dark bread. Alternatively, try a 'Leberkase semmel' (warm meat loaf in a white roll), which is very popular with locals, from students to blue-collar workers.Konditorei Heiner is one of my favorite cake shops in the center of Vienna. You can go mad with cream cakes, gugelhupfs (bundt cakes), fruit tarts, pralines, cookies, waffles, and macaroons... You can also try the famed Sachertorte here. Heiner is a former supplier to the Imperial Court, but far less touristy than Demel, another former supplier. The cake shop has three different salons, including one upstairs.Museumsquartier is Vienna's most exciting museum complex, housing more than 10 museums and cultural institutions. It's a great place to explore contemporary and 19th- and 20th-century art. Museumsquartier is located in the former Imperial stables, a beautiful baroque complex with a vast courtyard and funky lounge chairs that are perfect for relaxing.If you're always tempted to sneak behind private curtains, Hofzeile 27 is for you. For this private dining experience, Chef Sybille Fellner Kisler and her husband Wolfgang invite guests to their beautifully stylish townhouse in the leafy suburb of Doebling. The exquisite meals feature modern Austrian cuisine that can compete with top-quality Austrian restaurants. It's a fantastic way to explore contemporary urban living!Start your day with a Viennese breakfast at Cafe Museum, where Gustav Klimt used to take his coffee. I love the clean but cozy original 1930s feel: red velvet semi-circle benches, marble coffee tables, a fantastic selection of cakes and coffees, and very friendly service.On your way to nearby Naschmarkt, you will pass the Secession Building, Vienna's key Art Nouveau landmark. Compare it to the city's Baroque buildings and you will understand the artistic revolution at the start of the 20th century, when Gustav Klimt and a number of his contemporaries 'seceded' from the conservative K\u00fcnstlerhaus to found a new art association, (they commissioned the Secession Building as the exhibition space). Take the time to walk round the cubist architecture and to admire its signature globe of golden leaves.Naschmarkt is Vienna's most popular food market, and the perfect hunting ground for all things vintage. Soak up the multicultural Balkan flair and try not to be bothered by the crowds! The green cast-iron stalls are almost 100 years old, and the whole market dates back to the 16th century.From Naschmarkt, take the Vienna U-Bahn Metro (U4 line) out to Hietzing for lunch in one of Vienna's most beautiful residential neighborhoods. Plachutta restaurants are well known for tafelspitz, a traditional boiled beef dish that became popular because it was one of Emperor Francis Joseph's favorites; while Plachutta has several busy outlets in the city center, Hietzing is more off the beaten track.From Hietzing, take one Metro station back to Schoenbrunn Palace, Vienna's number one attraction (and rightly so). The Habsburg Emperor's summer residence, with its richly decorated salons and beautiful garden compound, brings back Vienna's Imperial past in all its pomp and glory. In the warmer months, make the effort to climb up to Gloriette Belvedere for coffee, cakes, and a beautiful view of Schoenbrunn and the city."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "58044c6dfc346a8631fa4bcc"}, "Budapest, Hungary ": "\nOver 15 million gallons of water bubble daily into Budapest's 118 springs and boreholes.

The \"Queen of the Danube\" is also steeped in history, culture and natural beauty. Get your camera ready for the Roman ruins of the Aquincum Museum, Heroes' Square and Statue Park, and the 300-foot dome of St. Stephen's Basilica.\n"}, {"Warsaw, Poland ": "\nWarsaw is a mixture of relaxing green spaces, historic sites and vivid modernity. Discover the charming Old Town, Wilan\u00f3w Palace and amazing Lazienki Park, where you can watch free Chopin concerts every Sunday during the summer. Experience a few of the dozens of interactive museums, including the Warsaw Uprising Museum, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews and the Copernicus Science Centre. For exciting nightlife, visit the vibrant Vistula boulevards and upscale clubs.\nHead for one of Warsaw\u2019s hardest hitting museums to get a handle on the city\u2019s recent history. The Warsaw Uprising Museum is housed in a former tram yard, leading visitors through the military and political events leading up to the uprising of 1944, which were pivotal in the destruction of the city by the occupying Nazis as revenge. Crammed with informative video interviews, stark black-and-white images showing the damage inflicted on the city, and flickering movies, the museum details the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939, events that led to the city rebelling against their rule, and the consequences of Soviet occupation following World War II. It\u2019s the perfect springboard to understanding the psyche of modern-day Warsaw.Warsaw\u2019s historic Stare Miasto (Old Town) is a tangle of gaily painted, gabled townhouse interspersed with cobbled squares. Largely annihilated during World War II, it was reconstructed in the 1970s under Soviet rule and is now UNESCO listed for its clutch of ornate Baroque churches, defence walls and fine architectural restoration.The heart of the Stare Miasto (Old Town) is the vast market square, with its origins in medieval times and now surrounded by a photogenic mishmash of Baroque townhouses. There\u2019s a market most days with stalls selling painted eggs, glassware and amber jewelry, and the piazza is lined with buzzing restaurants serving Polish specialities and bars offering local beers and potent cocktails.The handsome, red-brick Zamek Kr\u00f3lewski (Royal Castle) was originally built in the 15th century and was once home to the Polish monarchs. It was another victim of World War II but today its spectacularly opulent, refurbished apartments are once more stuffed full with ornate furniture, stucco decorations and marble corridors; they were all painstakingly restored after the war. The castle\u2019s fine art collections were largely plundered during Nazi and Soviet occupation of Warsaw, but many paintings have been returned, including some Rembrandts and a series of Canalettos featuring 17th-century Warsaw that were used as reference when the city was reconstructed in the late 20th century. Behind the castle, the terraced gardens look out over the River Vistula.The vast courtyard outside the Royal Castle is a favorite meeting point in the city; it is surrounded by restaurants and dominated by the vast statue of King Zygmunt III Waza, who moved the Polish capital to Warsaw from Krakow in 1596.A step away from the Royal Castle along the Royal Route is arguably the most beautiful neo-classical church in Warsaw; although a church has been on this site since medieval times, St Anne\u2019s was built in the mid 15th century and was given its present neo-classical fa\u00e7ade by architect Piotr Aigner in 1788. With a separate bell tower and a neat frontage topped by a pediment, the OTT interior is a fantasy of yellow, white and gold, gloomy biblical oil paintings, and mammoth chandeliers. Unusually for Warsaw, the church escaped serious damage during World War II but it subsequently nearly collapsed in 1949 due to tunnel building in the vicinity. Views from the tower are some of the best in Warsaw, worth the 150-step climb to see them.The Tomb of Unknown Soldier is found at the edge of the great public park where the Pa\u0142ac Saski (Saxon Palace) \u2014 destroyed during World War II \u2014 once stood. The marble mausoleum honors the fallen of Poland\u2019s many battles and wars, and especially the last two world wars; it was designed by Polish sculptor Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierz Ostrowski and is lit by an eternal flame. The somber memorial is guarded 24/7, with soldiers changing rota on the hour every hour.One of Warsaw\u2019s swankiest shopping streets, Nowy \u015awiat was leveled during World War II and reconstructed in a fairly bland architectural style. Nevertheless, it forms part of the Royal Route and is a popular shopping and partying spot, with a cluster of top designer names congregating around St Alexander\u2019s Church, including Burberry and Armani. Somewhat incongruously, the austere hulk of the former Communist HQ can be seen at Nowy \u015awiat 6.Once one of the grandest palaces in Europe, said to rival Versailles for its sheer opulence; the ornate, gigantic and multi-winged 17th-century Baroque summer retreat of King John Sobieski III survived the ravages of two world wars. Today it sits blissfully in landscaped gardens as a genteel reminder of the power, charm and wealth that was once Warsaw. The interior of the ocher, pink and white palace is of peerless luxury, with a series of ever more flamboyant apartments and staterooms adorned with marble, vivid swirling ceiling frescoes, priceless porcelains and silverware, sculptures, and stucco work. 1805 saw the opening of one of Warsaw\u2019s first decorative arts museums here, where star exhibits include traditional Polish wooden coffin portraits.The Copernicus Science Center is just the spot for an afternoon\u2019s interactive fun for families with kids. Named after Poland\u2019s greatest astrologer, the science center opened in 2012 and offers up several floors of educational but entertaining science \u2018light\u2019. Robots, 4-D films in the planetarium, laser shows and themed experiments in the labs that all add to the slightly chaotic fun.For decades Warsaw\u2019s highest building, the Palace of Culture and Science was constructed while the city was under Soviet occupation and was widely regarded as an eyesore looming over the city and resented as symbolic of Soviet domination in Poland. Largely abandoned after the Russians left in 1989, it is only now finding its place in history. At 231 meters (758 feet) tall, the gigantic Social Realist edifice today hosts rock concerts and is open for tours of its austere charms. Most people simply head for the viewing platform on the 30th floor, which reveals the restored streets and impressive new skyscrapers of central Warsaw spreading out below.Far from being a grimy, post-Soviet city, Warsaw is full of green spaces and foremost among these is \u0141azienki Park. Covering 78 hectares (192 acres) and forming part of the Royal Route, the landscaped gardens are scattered with lakes, waterfalls, an amphitheater, follies, and monuments to the great and good of Poland, including an Art Deco sculpture of Fryderyk Chopin. The park really comes into its own from late spring onwards, when it fills up with families picnicking, young couples strolling, and sightseers who come to see the how Poland\u2019s royalty once lived. Properties once inhabited by the Royal Family include the cosy White House \u2014 where the king\u2019s mistress was installed \u2014 the Baroque court theater, and the cast iron and glass Belvedere, now an expensive restaurant but originally an orangery.The neo-classical Palace on the Isle in \u0141azienki Park is beautifully situated overlooking a tranquil lake and is as rich in decoration inside as out. It was originally a royal bathhouse before being revamped in the early 18th century as the summer residence of Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland who died in 1798. When he moved in, the king brought his extensive collection of art with him and this forms the basis of the collections of fine art on display in the palace.The Chopin Museum is dedicated to Poland\u2019s favorite composer and showcases both his tumultuous love life side by side with his genius as a composer and musician. This state-of-the-art, interactive exhibition is one of a new raft of contemporary museums in Warsaw and is located in the elegant 17th-century Ostogski Palace. Holding the most comprehensive collection of Chopin ephemera in the world \u2014 manuscripts, portraits, pianos, scores, recordings, and love letters from novelist George Sand \u2014 the museum pays an absorbing and chronological tribute to his life.Opened piecemeal but finally completed in October 2014, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews is housed in a wacky ultra-modern glass and copper building on the site of Warsaw\u2019s former Jewish ghetto in Muran\u00f3w and examines the long relationship between the Jewish people and Poland. Before the advent of Nazi Germany in 1939, the Jews were an important and affluent section of the Warsaw community, but four short years brought about the eradication of 90 percent of the city\u2019s 3.3 million Jews in the Nazi death camps. This humanitarian tragedy is conveyed through the thoughtful use of multimedia displays, survivor interviews and a fine collection of Jewish paraphernalia.", "_id": {"$oid": "58044c75fc346a8631fa4bcd"}}, {"Barcelona, Spain ": "\nBarcelona feels a bit surreal \u2013 appropriate, since Salvador Dali spent time here and Spanish Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed designed several of the city\u2019s buildings.

This lovely Roman Catholic church is built on the Butte Montmartre, and as the highest point in Paris, it gives you a good view over the city. You can climb the 222 steps or take the funicular to reach the top. The Basilica was designed by Paul Abadie and Lucien Magne in Romano-byzantine style, and built to honor the 58,000 men that died during the Franco-Prussian War. The Sacr\u00e9 Coeur is situated in Montmartre, an idyllic and bohemian neighborhood full of lovely boutiques, restaurants and street art.At Boulevard de Clichy in the district of Pigalle, you'll find Le Moulin Rouge.

While you will not find many Parisians here (it is quite expensive and there are mainly chain stores), the most beautiful avenue in the world is still worth a visit. The buildings are beautiful and the little alleyways on both sides are full of bistros, bars and clubs to explore. Fans of the Tour de France may also know this place as the final stage of the race course!These chain restaurants are different, healthy and reasonably priced! There are now ten Paradis du Fruits in Paris and I personally love them all for their cocktails and smoothies. They serve large glasses, the fruit is fresh and you can mix them yourself. The dishes are mostly healthy and you can see the ingredients displayed and simply choose what you like the look of.This museum is really worth a visit. First of all, it is set in the lovely Latin Quarter of Paris, and second, the Panth\u00e9on is a mausoleum for the greatest French citizens. Some of the grands hommes you'll find here include Voltaire, Victor Hugo, Jean Moulin, Rousseau, Braille and Jean Jaur\u00e8s.

It is a French Gothic architectural marvel and was one of the first buildings to utilize the flying buttress. The famous gargoyles were designed as water spouts and its stained glass is just beautiful.The Latin Quarter is known for its restaurants, cafes, bistros and great student life \u2014 in particular, on the street Rue de la Hunchette. Come to this bright, happening part of the city any time of day and stay for a meal \u2014 while the food may not always be that amazing, the experience of the street is. This neighborhood is also home to the Sorbonne, one of world's first universities, and owes its name to the Latin language, which was the language spoken in the university during the Middle Ages!The Eiffel Tower ... Paris wouldn\u2019t be Paris without this iconic landmark! I think the best time to visit the Eiffel Tower is at night, when it is illuminated. Start at Trocadero to enjoy the best view of the tower (it's always busy, so it may take a while before you can take your perfect photo), and then walk down the stairs towards the tower until you arrive beneath it. After you've admired it up close, walk further on Champ de Mars and pause for a drink in the grass (on summer nights) or a romantic walk (on winter nights).This lovely little park takes you back to the old 17th century Paris, and is set in the heart of the Marais. The square was built by Henri IV and is the oldest square in Paris. Its orange buildings are quite idyllic and known to be the popular homes of French politicians like Dominic Strauss-Kahn. A century ago, it was also the home of Victor Hugo. whose house is nowadays a museum and worth a peek if you have time. In the streets surrounding the square, you\u2019ll also find the lively, unique atmosphere of the Marais just waiting to be explored.Centre Pompidou (locally known as Beaubourg) is my personal favorite museum in Paris, and is also fun for a short visit. This big colorful block in the middle of the city is quite unique, being the largest modern art museum in Europe, with famous works by Matisse, Picasso, Warhol, and others among its displays. It's also home to an interesting library, numerous special exhibits and some active research centers. Of course if you want to visit the whole museum and take your time, it isn\u2019t possible on a short visit, but with 2-3 hours to spare, you can see many of the great works and get a good general overview.The Tuileries Garden is located in the heart of Paris, next to the Louvre, and it's a great place to wander around. You can start with the Louvre itself \u2014 but bear in mind that it takes at least a week to see the whole of it and the queues are long! \u2014 or stick to the outside of the museum, with the pyramid of Pei, several expositions in the Tuileries, lovely sculptures and the Orangerie to explore.The place to be for locals and tourists alike, this Basque restaurant is a hit in Paris, with its relaxed atmosphere, big tables, friendly prices and best of all, delicious food.

His citadel on the Dambovita was the first of flotillas of palaces, many of which still stand. Four subway lines and a modern bus network transport visitors and commuters. Nicknamed \"Little Paris\", Bucharest's elegant early 20th-century architecture shows French influences. Don't miss the Village Museum, Romanian Athenaeum and the Peasant Museum. You can't miss the Palace of Parliament, the second-largest building in the world (after the Pentagon).\nBucharest's Palatul Poporului is one of the largest buildings in the world. While the commentary on the obligatory guided tour can be a little stilted, the building itself is amazing \u2014 a real monument to megalomania.This 19th century caravanserai (coaching inn) is the perfect spot for lunch, and the perfect contrast to the modernism of the Palatul Poporului.Offering classy walks along tree-lined paths, flower gardens and a boating lake, Bucharest's most central park is an elegant place to mix with locals and a see a little of the real city.The terrace here overlooks historic Piata Universitatii \u2014 a scene of much fighting during the 1989 revolution \u2014 and is perhaps the best place in town to simply watch the world go by.In the heart of the Old Town, MOJO doubles as Bucharest's best live music venue and the city's liveliest karaoke bar. A guaranteed good night out, Mojo offers well-priced drinks and stays open very late.A Bucharest essential, this superb outdoor museum set around Herastrau Lake offers a look at the life, traditions, architecture, and food of the Romanian countryside.

There's also a fantastic terrace which attracts the city's highest rollers in summer.Just to be sure you don't miss a thing, why not see almost every important Bucharest sight from the top of an open-top, double-decker bus? Though obviously a huge tourist magnet, it's also great value: Tickets are valid all day, and you can jump on and off as many times as you like.Romania's finest museum, this is a fascinating, moving look at the ingenuity of the Romanian peasant. The museum's shop also stocks high-quality traditional Romanian gifts and souvenirs.Slow food at its very best.

A stroll along its many waterways and canals illustrates why it has been called the \"Venice of the North.\" Don't miss a trip to the local fish market (Fischmarkt), the Merchants District (marked by its imposing red-brick architecture), a fine dining experience along the river or a night out in the university quarter. And did we mention the Reeperbahn (red light district)? It's quite famous for its\u2026 red lights.\nA highlight in Hamburg is a visit to the floating docks (Landungsbr\u00fccken). Enjoy a walk along the promenade here, with magnificent views of the Hamburg Harbour, filled with ships and seagulls. Continue your walk onto the docks, and you'll stumble across plenty of fish restaurants, offering deliciously fresh fish rolls -- a must-try!Hamburg is synonymous with water, so a harbour cruise on the river Elbe is a must! Departing from Landungsbr\u00fccken, a variety of companies operate cruises through the canals of the Speicherstadt, passing the Container Terminal and continuing along Blankenese to the expensive houses of some of the city's wealthiest residents.Strolling along the Landungsbr\u00fccken promenade will eventually lead you to the historic area of Speicherstadt (meaning warehouse district). Here striking red warehouses, built on timber piles, lie between narrow canals. Once a custom-free zone where coffee and spices were stored, the area has been redeveloped and is today home to many offices and interesting museums.Deep below the river Elbe lies the Old Elbtunnel, which allows pedestrians, cyclists and cars to get from one side of the riverbank to the other. It is a protected national monument, and not used as often as the new Elbtunnel. It is definitely still worth a visit -- the tiles on its walls will soon transport you back to the 1970\u2019s, when it was built. Plus, on the other side of the tunnel, you'll be rewarded with an amazing view of the Landungsbr\u00fccken.Schanzenviertel -- a lively and hip student district -- may look a bit shabby from the outside, but it is home to many great bars and good-quality international restaurants. While not the best place for dancing the night away, this is my favourite spot in which to enjoy a good chat with friends over a drink (or two).With all the nearby shopping streets to browse and Alster lake to admire, kicking a day of sightseeing off at the Town Hall in the city centre makes good sense. Start with a coffee on the square in front of the town hall, while you marvel at the green roof and clock tower from the exterior. Then, once you venture inside, join one of the interesting daily tours that will take you around all the fancy, shiny rooms.North of the Town Hall, you'll find the start of major shopping street, M\u00f6nckebergstrasse (or \"The M\u00f6\" as its known locally). Shopping fans won't be disappointed by the range of well-known and international brands on offer here in its many shops, department stores, and huge mall (Europa Passage). As you browse, don't forget to keep an eye out for the beautiful old houses that also line this street.Considered the \"heart of Hamburg,\" Jungfernstieg is a street and promenade on the south coast of the inner Alster lake. Here you'll find lots of shops, restaurants and boat tour companies to choose from. I recommend taking a walk around the inner Alster lake starting here, then passing luxury hotels as you head in the direction of the Kennedy bridge, from where you can enjoy a fantastic panorama view of Hamburg city centre.Just a short walk from Jungfernstieg is the urban oasis \"Planten und Blomen,\" a park with many green areas, and various types of flowers and trees, as well as lakes and a tropical garden. In winter you can go ice-skating here, but the park is at its best in summer, when the flowerbeds are in bloom, and you can simply relax on the grass. You'll soon forget you're in a city with 1.7 million inhabitants!Love it or hate it, Hamburg's garish Reeperbahn -- the red light district -- is an iconic neighbourhood, and worth passing through if only to experience the amusing, neon-lit underbelly of the city. You'll find all types of bars, clubs and clientele here, if you decide to stop and people-watch for a while.You'll find plenty of food and plenty of noise at the Hamburger Fischmarkt, which today sells much more than fish, as its name would suggest. Nowadays you can buy everything from large baskets of fruit and veg to noodles -- and of course, fish -- here and sample plenty of produce while you browse. Just be prepared to rise at the crack of dawn!We Hamburg locals fondly refer to the main protestant church of Stankt Mechaeliskirche (St. Michael's Church) simply as \"Michel.\" With a clock tower that stands 132 metres tall, offering stunning panoramic views of the city, it's little surprise that this building is an iconic Hamburg landmark and incredibly popular with tour buses. The area surrounding it is also worth exploring: Though a little hidden by this dominating structure, the cute group of Krameramtswohnungen (17th century timber houses, built to house Trader's Guild widows) situated here have been converted into a small art gallery and restaurant.Beautiful mansions line the banks of the outer Alster lake, and the best way to get a closer peek is to rent a canoe or paddleboat and head out onto the water. Once you've explored the lake's many beautiful small canals, head back to dry land and walk or cycle around the shore."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "58044df2fc346a87b95fa3b0"}, "Vienna, Austria ": "\nIn Vienna, the coffee house isn\u2019t just a hangout: it\u2019s an institution. Lingering over a newspaper with a pastry and a strong espresso drink is, according to UNESCO, officially a Viennese cultural pastime. Walk off your slice of Sachertorte with a self-guided tour of the city\u2019s stunning traditional, Secessionist, and modern architecture, such as the Imperial Palace, the State Opera House, the Kirche am Steinhof, or the Kunsthistorisches Museum, an exercise in ornate geometry.\nVienna's state boulevard girds the city center and is the perfect place to orient yourself. It stands in the place of the former city walls, which were torn down after the Napoleonic Wars. Take the Yellow Ring Tram for a 30-minute tour past beautiful buildings such as state museums, the Opera, Austrian Parliament, Vienna City Hall, and Stadtpark.Vienna's luxury shopping mile is part of the pedestrian area in the center, running between the State Opera and St. Stephen's Cathedral. The most famous shops are Oesterreichische Werkstaetten and glass manufacturer Lobmeyr Swarovski's stunning flagship store. However, Kaerntnerstrasse is better for window shopping than souvenir shopping.Winterpalais is a hidden gem of a town palace, and many travelers discover it by chance. It's located just off Kaerntnerstrasse and has only 10 rooms, so it won't overwhelm you on your first day. The palace once belonged to Prince Eugene of Savoy, one of Austria's most famous military commanders.Situated on the outskirts of Vienna, the historic tavern Zu den drei Hacken (To the Three Axes) provides a rustic break from Kaerntnerstrasse. The place is well known, busy, and a great introduction to classic Viennese cuisine \u2014 from schnitzel (breaded meat) to schweinsbraten (roast pork loin) and knoedel (dumplings).Situated on Ringstrasse, the Museum of Applied Arts displays a wide array of Viennese arts and crafts, from 14th-century stained glass to 1950s figurines. Highlights include an excellent collection of Biedermeier sofas and Thonet chairs.If people ask me for a great insider place to have Austrian food, I often recommend Restaurant Silberwirt, for a variety of reasons. First, the menu covers the best of Austrian delicacies, including contemporary favorites. Second, the building complex, Schlossquadrat, dates from the 14th century and is a historic gem with a romantic courtyard. Finally, it's located off the beaten path in the trendy district of Margareten, popular with urban professionals and young families alike.For six centuries, Vienna was the capital of the mighty Austro-Hungarian Empire, ruled by Habsburg dynasty. The Hofburg, home of the Habsburgs from the first emperor in 1273 until the last in 1918, grew in scope and grandeur over the years, as each emperor sought to outdo his predecessors. Today, it houses a cornucopia of attractions, including six museums, the National Library, and the Imperial Apartments. To get a feel for this place that was at the center of European history for hundreds of years, start in the middle and work your way out.After so much pomp, treat yourself to a down-to-earth meal of Vienna sausage at a traditional Wurstelstand (sausage stand). Bitzinger's is located near the State Opera and serves up tasty treats. The sausages are cut up and served with mustard and a roll or a slice of dark bread. Alternatively, try a 'Leberkase semmel' (warm meat loaf in a white roll), which is very popular with locals, from students to blue-collar workers.Konditorei Heiner is one of my favorite cake shops in the center of Vienna. You can go mad with cream cakes, gugelhupfs (bundt cakes), fruit tarts, pralines, cookies, waffles, and macaroons... You can also try the famed Sachertorte here. Heiner is a former supplier to the Imperial Court, but far less touristy than Demel, another former supplier. The cake shop has three different salons, including one upstairs.Museumsquartier is Vienna's most exciting museum complex, housing more than 10 museums and cultural institutions. It's a great place to explore contemporary and 19th- and 20th-century art. Museumsquartier is located in the former Imperial stables, a beautiful baroque complex with a vast courtyard and funky lounge chairs that are perfect for relaxing.If you're always tempted to sneak behind private curtains, Hofzeile 27 is for you. For this private dining experience, Chef Sybille Fellner Kisler and her husband Wolfgang invite guests to their beautifully stylish townhouse in the leafy suburb of Doebling. The exquisite meals feature modern Austrian cuisine that can compete with top-quality Austrian restaurants. It's a fantastic way to explore contemporary urban living!Start your day with a Viennese breakfast at Cafe Museum, where Gustav Klimt used to take his coffee. I love the clean but cozy original 1930s feel: red velvet semi-circle benches, marble coffee tables, a fantastic selection of cakes and coffees, and very friendly service.On your way to nearby Naschmarkt, you will pass the Secession Building, Vienna's key Art Nouveau landmark. Compare it to the city's Baroque buildings and you will understand the artistic revolution at the start of the 20th century, when Gustav Klimt and a number of his contemporaries 'seceded' from the conservative K\u00fcnstlerhaus to found a new art association, (they commissioned the Secession Building as the exhibition space). Take the time to walk round the cubist architecture and to admire its signature globe of golden leaves.Naschmarkt is Vienna's most popular food market, and the perfect hunting ground for all things vintage. Soak up the multicultural Balkan flair and try not to be bothered by the crowds! The green cast-iron stalls are almost 100 years old, and the whole market dates back to the 16th century.From Naschmarkt, take the Vienna U-Bahn Metro (U4 line) out to Hietzing for lunch in one of Vienna's most beautiful residential neighborhoods. Plachutta restaurants are well known for tafelspitz, a traditional boiled beef dish that became popular because it was one of Emperor Francis Joseph's favorites; while Plachutta has several busy outlets in the city center, Hietzing is more off the beaten track.From Hietzing, take one Metro station back to Schoenbrunn Palace, Vienna's number one attraction (and rightly so). The Habsburg Emperor's summer residence, with its richly decorated salons and beautiful garden compound, brings back Vienna's Imperial past in all its pomp and glory. In the warmer months, make the effort to climb up to Gloriette Belvedere for coffee, cakes, and a beautiful view of Schoenbrunn and the city."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "58044dfefc346a87b95fa3b1"}, "Budapest, Hungary ": "\nOver 15 million gallons of water bubble daily into Budapest's 118 springs and boreholes.

The \"Queen of the Danube\" is also steeped in history, culture and natural beauty. Get your camera ready for the Roman ruins of the Aquincum Museum, Heroes' Square and Statue Park, and the 300-foot dome of St. Stephen's Basilica.\nNo trip to Budapest is complete without a visit to Castle Hill (Varhegy). Take a walk around the cobbled streets of this historic part of the city, and make sure you head up to Fisherman's Bastion, one of my favorite lookout points in the whole city. It's a nice area to simply wander, but if you want to step inside for a while, you can visit the Hungarian National Gallery in Buda Castle.A must-see while in Budapest \u2014 Chain Bridge (Szechenyi Lanchid) is easily the city's most beautiful bridge, with stunning views over the Danube and up to Castle Hill. Pedestrian-friendly, it's definitely worth walking across and taking the time to savor the view.For a taste of the modern Hungarian kitchen, Kantin is the place where I like to take my friends. The set menu here is a good price, and you can mix and match your starters. The dishes are seasonal and made with fresh local ingredients. The chic industrial interior might lack the romantic feel other restaurants have, but you can't really beat it for location as it's right in the heart of the city.One of my favorite buildings in Budapest, the Hungarian State Opera House is one of the city's most beautiful monuments and a must-see on your trip to the Hungarian capital. If you have more time then make sure you catch a show, otherwise you can simply take a guided tour of the interior. And if you're really in a hurry, then just stop by and snap a photo!If you're hankering for a spot of coffee, then the Book Cafe (Lotz Terem) on Andrassy Avenue is a must. Entering the art deco building, you'll first find yourself in a modern bookstore, but keep going and take the escalator up to the top and you'll discover a cafe that looks like a Venetian Palace. I love stopping by here for a cup of coffee when I want to treat myself.Walking around the city can be tiring and sometimes you need a good pick-me-up. An afternoon at the Sz\u00e9chenyi Baths is the ideal way to enjoy the city and relax at the same time. The thermal waters here hold curative properties and bubble up warm, making them perfect to bathe in all year round. You can either splash about in the main area or soak yourself in the steaming hot pool where the old men sit around and play chess for hours.The City Park (Varosliget) is Budapest's green lung and a popular spot for a stroll, with the Vajdahunyad Castle as the highlight. The romantic turreted building is actually inspired by the castle of the same name in Transylvania. It's one of my favorite places in the city, and while I wouldn't recommend the museum inside \u2014 unless you're a fan of taxidermy \u2014 the grounds are easily worth at least a short walk.Heroes' Square sits right up between the City Park and Andrassy Avenue. It's one of Budapest's most visited sites and an optimal place to snap a photo. Take a look at the statues of Hungarian kings up along the colonnades!Budapest has an amazing nightlife thanks to its ruin-style bar scene. Szimpla Kert was the original ruin-style bar that started life as a squat-cum-bar in the dilapidated VII District downtown, and which has since turned into a cultural phenomenon. If you haven't been to a ruin-style bar before, then stepping into Szimpla will feel like being transported into a surreal world housed in a crumbling apartment block."}, {"Warsaw, Poland ": "\nWarsaw is a mixture of relaxing green spaces, historic sites and vivid modernity. Discover the charming Old Town, Wilan\u00f3w Palace and amazing Lazienki Park, where you can watch free Chopin concerts every Sunday during the summer. Experience a few of the dozens of interactive museums, including the Warsaw Uprising Museum, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews and the Copernicus Science Centre. For exciting nightlife, visit the vibrant Vistula boulevards and upscale clubs.\nHead for one of Warsaw\u2019s hardest hitting museums to get a handle on the city\u2019s recent history. The Warsaw Uprising Museum is housed in a former tram yard, leading visitors through the military and political events leading up to the uprising of 1944, which were pivotal in the destruction of the city by the occupying Nazis as revenge. Crammed with informative video interviews, stark black-and-white images showing the damage inflicted on the city, and flickering movies, the museum details the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939, events that led to the city rebelling against their rule, and the consequences of Soviet occupation following World War II. It\u2019s the perfect springboard to understanding the psyche of modern-day Warsaw.Warsaw\u2019s historic Stare Miasto (Old Town) is a tangle of gaily painted, gabled townhouse interspersed with cobbled squares. Largely annihilated during World War II, it was reconstructed in the 1970s under Soviet rule and is now UNESCO listed for its clutch of ornate Baroque churches, defence walls and fine architectural restoration.The heart of the Stare Miasto (Old Town) is the vast market square, with its origins in medieval times and now surrounded by a photogenic mishmash of Baroque townhouses. There\u2019s a market most days with stalls selling painted eggs, glassware and amber jewelry, and the piazza is lined with buzzing restaurants serving Polish specialities and bars offering local beers and potent cocktails.The handsome, red-brick Zamek Kr\u00f3lewski (Royal Castle) was originally built in the 15th century and was once home to the Polish monarchs. It was another victim of World War II but today its spectacularly opulent, refurbished apartments are once more stuffed full with ornate furniture, stucco decorations and marble corridors; they were all painstakingly restored after the war. The castle\u2019s fine art collections were largely plundered during Nazi and Soviet occupation of Warsaw, but many paintings have been returned, including some Rembrandts and a series of Canalettos featuring 17th-century Warsaw that were used as reference when the city was reconstructed in the late 20th century. Behind the castle, the terraced gardens look out over the River Vistula.The vast courtyard outside the Royal Castle is a favorite meeting point in the city; it is surrounded by restaurants and dominated by the vast statue of King Zygmunt III Waza, who moved the Polish capital to Warsaw from Krakow in 1596.A step away from the Royal Castle along the Royal Route is arguably the most beautiful neo-classical church in Warsaw; although a church has been on this site since medieval times, St Anne\u2019s was built in the mid 15th century and was given its present neo-classical fa\u00e7ade by architect Piotr Aigner in 1788. With a separate bell tower and a neat frontage topped by a pediment, the OTT interior is a fantasy of yellow, white and gold, gloomy biblical oil paintings, and mammoth chandeliers. Unusually for Warsaw, the church escaped serious damage during World War II but it subsequently nearly collapsed in 1949 due to tunnel building in the vicinity. Views from the tower are some of the best in Warsaw, worth the 150-step climb to see them.The Tomb of Unknown Soldier is found at the edge of the great public park where the Pa\u0142ac Saski (Saxon Palace) \u2014 destroyed during World War II \u2014 once stood. The marble mausoleum honors the fallen of Poland\u2019s many battles and wars, and especially the last two world wars; it was designed by Polish sculptor Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierz Ostrowski and is lit by an eternal flame. The somber memorial is guarded 24/7, with soldiers changing rota on the hour every hour.One of Warsaw\u2019s swankiest shopping streets, Nowy \u015awiat was leveled during World War II and reconstructed in a fairly bland architectural style. Nevertheless, it forms part of the Royal Route and is a popular shopping and partying spot, with a cluster of top designer names congregating around St Alexander\u2019s Church, including Burberry and Armani. Somewhat incongruously, the austere hulk of the former Communist HQ can be seen at Nowy \u015awiat 6.Once one of the grandest palaces in Europe, said to rival Versailles for its sheer opulence; the ornate, gigantic and multi-winged 17th-century Baroque summer retreat of King John Sobieski III survived the ravages of two world wars. Today it sits blissfully in landscaped gardens as a genteel reminder of the power, charm and wealth that was once Warsaw. The interior of the ocher, pink and white palace is of peerless luxury, with a series of ever more flamboyant apartments and staterooms adorned with marble, vivid swirling ceiling frescoes, priceless porcelains and silverware, sculptures, and stucco work. 1805 saw the opening of one of Warsaw\u2019s first decorative arts museums here, where star exhibits include traditional Polish wooden coffin portraits.The Copernicus Science Center is just the spot for an afternoon\u2019s interactive fun for families with kids. Named after Poland\u2019s greatest astrologer, the science center opened in 2012 and offers up several floors of educational but entertaining science \u2018light\u2019. Robots, 4-D films in the planetarium, laser shows and themed experiments in the labs that all add to the slightly chaotic fun.For decades Warsaw\u2019s highest building, the Palace of Culture and Science was constructed while the city was under Soviet occupation and was widely regarded as an eyesore looming over the city and resented as symbolic of Soviet domination in Poland. Largely abandoned after the Russians left in 1989, it is only now finding its place in history. At 231 meters (758 feet) tall, the gigantic Social Realist edifice today hosts rock concerts and is open for tours of its austere charms. Most people simply head for the viewing platform on the 30th floor, which reveals the restored streets and impressive new skyscrapers of central Warsaw spreading out below.Far from being a grimy, post-Soviet city, Warsaw is full of green spaces and foremost among these is \u0141azienki Park. Covering 78 hectares (192 acres) and forming part of the Royal Route, the landscaped gardens are scattered with lakes, waterfalls, an amphitheater, follies, and monuments to the great and good of Poland, including an Art Deco sculpture of Fryderyk Chopin. The park really comes into its own from late spring onwards, when it fills up with families picnicking, young couples strolling, and sightseers who come to see the how Poland\u2019s royalty once lived. Properties once inhabited by the Royal Family include the cosy White House \u2014 where the king\u2019s mistress was installed \u2014 the Baroque court theater, and the cast iron and glass Belvedere, now an expensive restaurant but originally an orangery.The neo-classical Palace on the Isle in \u0141azienki Park is beautifully situated overlooking a tranquil lake and is as rich in decoration inside as out. It was originally a royal bathhouse before being revamped in the early 18th century as the summer residence of Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland who died in 1798. When he moved in, the king brought his extensive collection of art with him and this forms the basis of the collections of fine art on display in the palace.The Chopin Museum is dedicated to Poland\u2019s favorite composer and showcases both his tumultuous love life side by side with his genius as a composer and musician. This state-of-the-art, interactive exhibition is one of a new raft of contemporary museums in Warsaw and is located in the elegant 17th-century Ostogski Palace. Holding the most comprehensive collection of Chopin ephemera in the world \u2014 manuscripts, portraits, pianos, scores, recordings, and love letters from novelist George Sand \u2014 the museum pays an absorbing and chronological tribute to his life.Opened piecemeal but finally completed in October 2014, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews is housed in a wacky ultra-modern glass and copper building on the site of Warsaw\u2019s former Jewish ghetto in Muran\u00f3w and examines the long relationship between the Jewish people and Poland. Before the advent of Nazi Germany in 1939, the Jews were an important and affluent section of the Warsaw community, but four short years brought about the eradication of 90 percent of the city\u2019s 3.3 million Jews in the Nazi death camps. This humanitarian tragedy is conveyed through the thoughtful use of multimedia displays, survivor interviews and a fine collection of Jewish paraphernalia.", "_id": {"$oid": "58044e08fc346a87b95fa3b2"}}, {"Barcelona, Spain ": "\nBarcelona feels a bit surreal \u2013 appropriate, since Salvador Dali spent time here and Spanish Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed designed several of the city\u2019s buildings.

Unlike many other galleries this museum centers on one unique item: a recovered warship, restored almost entirely to its original state.

But remnants of the area's history also remain - while walking through, you'll discover many 'tenements with communal balconies,' typical Milan council houses also called 'case di ringhiera.'It may be hard to believe, but Monumental Cemetery is the second most visited place in Milan, after the Cathedral. Also called an 'open-air museum,' the Cimitero Monumentale is an ode to history, art, and ostentation.

Art galleries, narrow streets, canals, parks, and Baroque churches round out the city\u2019s cultural attractions.\nA UNESCO World Heritage site, Kronborg Slot (Kronborg Castle) is one of the most important Renaissance castles in Northern Europe, and the architecture is very impressive. There has been a castle at this site in Helsing\u00f8r, just north of Copenhagen, since the 1420s, although it was rebuilt and expanded throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The castle has a strategic position, near the water passage between Sweden and Denmark that is one of the only outlets of the Baltic Sea. Together with K\u00e4rnan (The Core in English) in Helsingborg, Sweden, Kronborg used to maintain a coastal fortification and have full control of the outlet. And, of course, the castle is also well known the world over because a certain playwright decided to set some play called 'Hamlet' here.One of the most important legends of Danish history sleeps in Helsingborg. Holger Danske actually made his first appearance in medieval French literature as \u2018Ogier le Danois,\u2019 but his story has become legend and his statue is an important Danish artifact.

Louisiana is mainly known for paintings and artworks dating from the end of World War II up until today, but it also functions as a milestone for Danish architecture.

After collecting an impressive amount of Danish art, it started to pursue foreign contemporary and modern art, and selectively picked out beautiful paintings, sculptures and other art objects and artifacts.

This one is simple, seasonal, and delicious.Christiansborg. Where to start? Christiansborg is the political stronghold of Denmark \u2013 home of the parliament. This impressive (neo-)baroque building used to be the principal residence for the Danish kings. Today it is still used partially by the Danish royal family, but its primary function is as the home of executive, judicial and legislative power. Christianborg has something for everyone, as it gives great insights into so many different aspects of Danish history: the monarchy, the architecture, the politics and artworks. Visiting Folketinget (The Parliament) can only be done with a guide, but the royal reception rooms, chapel, royal stables, old ruins and museum can all be visited without a guide - and are all well worth exploring!Islands Brygge is a quay located on the coast of Amager that was artificially constructed during the 1880s.

Because Islands Brygge is a local favorite for the (especially younger) crowd of Copenhagen, it's an easy way to mingle with the locals and get some tips and insights into the culture of Copenhagen.One of the things I personally love about Copenhagen is all the green areas and all the water. Besides canals and actual harbors/docks, there are even a few lakes in the inner city.

The lakes are now used mainly for recreational and leisure purposes, and during the summer this is a also great place to mingle with the locals. Many Copenhageners come here on the summer weekends to relax and tan. Bike and footpaths surround the water, and the surrounding architecture is just stunning.Copenhagen has beautifully curved canals, which serve as buffer zones between many of the areas.

The castle houses the crown jewels and many hundreds of years of royal history. Rosenborg is located in Kongens Haven (The King's Garden), which is absolutely beautiful and relaxing during summer.Though it's not the cheapest attraction in Copenhagen, Tivoli Gardens is a must see! I think of it as something rather special and unique to Copenhagen; it is an amusement park as well as a beautiful garden, and it can be found just between the municipality and the central station, right in the heart of the inner city between Str\u00f8get (the shopping street) and the hip and attractive area of Vesterbro. Tivoli Gardens is so magical that Walt Disney came here for inspiration, and it's so unique and special that the King of Pop (Michael Jackson himself) wanted to buy it. The theme park is lively in the summer and cozy in the winter. You\u2019ll find all kinds of rides, concerts, food and snacks, exhibitions and beautiful and well kept gardens. It is easy to spend several hours or an entire day here, and it is a must-see for anyone spending more than one day in Copenhagen.If you love fish and shellfish, this is the place to go!

Today its winding backstreets hum with bars, restaurants and craft stores.Constructed of pink-tinted local limestone, this very beautiful building is one of Marseille's architectural masterpieces. Once an alms house and a prison, today it houses arts centers, a museum and superb temporary exhibitions.Set at the mouth of the Old Port, local architect Rudy Ricciotti's amazing black cube is an architectural marvel. The gardens and adjacent Fort Saint Louis are great to wander around, with stupendous views. Inside, though, the exhibitions are less exciting.Marseille's landscaped cathedral sits right on the seafront. Its restored vaults now house high-end boutiques, bars and even a gourmet food market. The gardens have a playground, lots of benches and superb views.For serious shoppers only: this enormous, shiny, modern mall sits on the seafront in the commercial port area, and is bound to have what you're looking for.Part citadelle, part beacon - this is THE iconic symbol of Marseille, and much loved by locals, who always call it the Bonne M\u00e8re (Good Mother). You don't need to be religious to be stunned by the incredible panoramic views here.This is one of the oldest and most beautiful churches in Marseille - visit it while walking back down the hill from Notre Dame de la Garde.The iconic fortress prison where the Count of Monte Cristo, Dumas' fictional hero, languished for years (as well as many real-life prisoners).If you only visit one museum in Marseille, make it this one: restored and reopened in 2013, it's a fascinating, beautifully presented trip through the city's millennia of history.Marseille's trendy 'bo-bo' (bourgeois-bohemian) district, celebrated for its buzzing bars and brilliant street art, is definitely worth a wander.The city's unmissable sight: Marseille's spectacular Mediterranean 'fjords.' Go by on food, or by boat, car or rail - it's up to you (and the weather).A pretty little fishing port in the heart of the metropolis. Take a short ride on a local bus and you'll forget you're in France's second city.Pioneering architect Le Corbusier's post-war housing project is a modernist masterpiece. The Marseillais, with typical irreverence, call it the 'madman's house!'You don't need to be a football fan to appreciate this: Marseille's football stadium has had a major makeover and it's now a stunner. Plus, it's just down the road from the Cite Radieuse, making it a good spot to visit in tandem.After lots of sightseeing, a few hours on one of Marseille's beaches makes for a great reward.

You will be awed by this magnificent architectural jewel that's part of the cultural identity of Valencia. Not to be missed!Probably the finest example of a civil Gothic building in Spain, this 15th-century market was declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996, and is a beautiful reminder of the huge trading power the city held in the Middle Ages. You'll be amazed when you enter the 17-meter-high column room, with its intricately-decorated vaulted ceiling. Not to be missed.This beautiful 13th-century church, built over an ancient mosque, suffered several fires and was rebuilt in the baroque style. Its imposing facade is one of the must-see views in Valencia, and inside you'll find numerous fresco paintings and beautifully decorated chapels. It's a gem!This relatively small church has an impressively decorated baroque dome and beautiful altarpieces, as well as important frescoes. It is the home to the patron Virgin of Valencia, so you'll find a religious atmosphere here.One of the former Twelve Gates to the City, this pair of towers dates back to the 14th-century. The towers were built as part of the medieval wall surrounding the city. Among Valencia's best-preserved monuments, they are considered the main city entrance. From here, the fallera mayor announces the beginning of the Fallas festival on the last Sunday of February. A true symbol of the city!These medieval dockyards are an indicator of the importance of Valencian sea trade centuries ago. Used not only as a place to build ships, but also as a defensive building against African pirates, and as a salt warehouse later on, they are now home to the Maritime Museum. A nice visit near the harbor.Just a few miles south of Valencia, this beautiful natural park is the perfect place for a day out. Albufera means 'saltwater lagoon' in Arabic, and it's separated from the sea by just a strip of sand. This natural environment is full of life and the park has a huge ecological value, as it's home to many endangered species. Here you'll find a flooded landscape covered in rice paddies where you might spot rabbits, ducks, snails, and all sort of fish. There are beautiful views everywhere you look, and photography aficionados will be thrilled with the endless possibilities of Albuferas magnificent sunsets.Playa de la Malvarrosa is the main beach in Valencia city proper. A visit is not complete without walking barefoot on the soft sand of this long, wide beach any time of year. Both the beach and seafront promenade are very lively all day long: You'll find all sort of restaurants, bars and pubs to refresh in, and many activities that take place on its vast space. Another option is renting a parasol with a safe and enjoying a nice bath in the clean waters of the Mediterranean.This zoo is one of the best rated ones in Europe. No wonder, the reproductions of African natural habitats are really well achieved. There is a wide variety of animals that are better taken care of than in most zoos. You'll feel as if you were visiting them in their real homes, as the park has been built to conceal the barriers between visitors and animals.This beautiful park is a referent point in the city, known as the 'lung of Valencia.' It spreads over 10 miles, from Bioparc to City of Arts and Sciences, and is perfect for running, strolling, and cycling. Its interesting shape is due to it having been built over the former riverbed of Turia River, which was diverted to the south of the city after huge floods during the 1950s. You'll find leisure, nature, and interesting architecture along the way.In the Turia Gardens you will find two bridges designed by famous architect Santiago Calatrava. One is Pont de l'Exposici\u00f3 (popularly known as 'La Peineta' \u2014 'The Comb',) and the other is l'Assut de l'Or (or \"El Arpa\" \u2014 'The Harp'.) Calatrava's futuristic works have many admirers but also numerous detractors. Go visit and decide for yourself!This modern cinema is part of the City of Arts and Sciences and has a huge IMAX dome that projects science and technology documentaries in 3D, as well as astronomy shows. From the outside, the impressive building by Calatrava reflected in the water will remind you of an eye, both by day and by night. You definitely shouldn't miss this new emblem of Valencia!Palau de les Arts is Valencia's Opera Theatre and headquarters of the Valencian Community Orchestra.

It was developing into an industrial and trading power when German bombers destroyed the city center and harbor in 1940. However, Rotterdam's unique architecture now brings many visitors to bike around this urbane, cosmopolitan city. Old Dutch-style houses can still be found in historic Delfshaven, from where the pilgrims set sail in 1620.

It was the central site of the Nazi General Government during WWII, and there\u2019s still a residual feeling of solemnity here that\u2019s especially apparent during visits to the Plaszow Concentration Camp and the Oskar Schindler Factory. Both the Historic City Centre and the Jewish District are brimming with caf\u00e9s, shops, and pubs, and the 10-acre Main Market Square is a medieval feast for the senses.\nPoland\u2019s most beautiful medieval market square is also its biggest; at 200 square meters the Rynek G\u0142\u00f3wny (Main Market Square) is the social hub of Krakow, lined with pastel-colored townhouses and clusters of cafes and restaurants that spread onto the cobblestones in summer. It should be your number-one stop for the horse-and-carriage tours, the flower stalls, the weekend antiques market and the never-ending supply of jugglers and living statues. If that\u2019s not enough, the Rynek is also home to three of Krakow\u2019s biggest attractions: St Mary\u2019s Basilica, the Cloth Hall and the city\u2019s newest, glossiest museum: the Rynek Underground.Occupying pole position at the southeast corner of the Rynek is the misleadingly plain red-brick exterior of St Mary\u2019s Basilica, chiefly admired for its mismatched spires; the northern tower stands 80 meters high and it is here that the traditional hourly bugle call rings out across the city. The interior of the church could not be more different \u2014 a mad Baroque frenzy of adornment, where a sky-blue ceiling scattered with gold stars competes for attention with gleaming stained-glass windows, patterned marble flooring and altar paintings by 19th-century masters. And yet all of this is outshone still by the immense, intricately carved altarpiece, one of Poland\u2019s artistic treasures and the best work of sculptor Veit Stoss, who was much in demand for his wood-carving skills in 15th-century central Europe.Sitting smack in the middle of the Rynek, the Cloth Hall (Sukiennice) has its origins in medieval times and started life as a medieval trading hall \u2014 the world\u2019s first undercover shopping mall. Today its delicate, Neo-Gothic proportions hide a souvenir-hunter\u2019s paradise on its ground floor, with scores of market stalls flogging brightly costumed wooden puppets, hand-painted eggs, cheery textiles and decently-priced amber and jet jewelry. It has a surprise on the upper floor too, in the shape of the glorious but sadly often-overlooked gallery of 19th-century Polish Art (Galeria Sztuki Polskiej XIX Wieku), displaying vast historical canvasses by Jan Matejko and abstract work by the nation\u2019s favorite, Witkacy.Krakow\u2019s newest, flashiest museum has been carved out \u2013 at vast expense \u2013 directly underneath the Cloth Hall and sits at the medieval level of the city. It provides a thoughtful jaunt through the historical and cultural development of Krakow using clever multi-media presentations, interactive models, touch-screens and multi-lingual labeling. Highlights include walking among the excavated walls of the medieval marketplace, getting weighed in medieval units and the films showcasing Poland\u2019s past.The oldest restaurant in Krakow (Wierzynek opened its doors in 1364) is also one of its best, with elegant surroundings, historic portraits and weaponry on the walls, decorative timbered ceilings and suitably hushed service. The excellent menu teams the very finest of Polish cuisine with contemporary flair to produce dishes such as venison tartar and wild boar goulash.At the end of Krakow\u2019s Royal Route \u2014 the path taken by medieval Polish kings on their way to their coronation \u2014 Wawel Castle sits on a hill south of the Old Town and is Poland\u2019s emotional heart. This jumble of palace, chapels, cathedral, colonnaded courtyards, armories and crypts sits behind fortified walls and was built in a clash of Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles from the 14th century onwards. Highlights of a visit here include Poland\u2019s Crown Jewels in the treasury; the royal tombs and Russian murals in the cathedral; and the highly decorative apartments and state art collections in the castle.Immortalized by Spielberg\u2019s award-winning film Schindler\u2019s List, Oskar Schindler was a Nazi who saved the lives of hundreds of Polish Jews by employing them in his enamel factory. Today that factory operates as a profoundly moving museum of the Holocaust in Krakow, utilizing graphic images, 3D dioramas, video testimonies and interactive displays that run chronologically from the arrival of the Nazis in 1939, through the gradual extinction of the city and its inhabitants in the death camps of P\u0142asz\u00f3w and Auschwitz-Birkenau, and on to liberation in 1945.An award-winning and minuscule museum in Kazimierz, Galicia features a heart-warming collection of rarely seen images of Jewish life during the 20 years around World War II, as well as an exhibition celebrating Jewish culture in Eastern Europe. It is strangely almost unknown on the Krakow tourist trail, which makes a visit doubly worth the effort.Buzzy Kazimierz is the former Jewish ghetto that today houses some of the wackiest, most stylish independent stores, art galleries, bars and clubs in Krakow. It\u2019s best to tour the tangle of streets and hidden courtyards off the main square of Plac Nowy and find a spot that suits your mood to sit back with a coffee and watch bohemian Krakow pass by.Krakow\u2019s grandest beer hall is also one of its most popular; you may have to stand in line at the city\u2019s longest bar to get your hands on a glass of home-brewed honey beer but the taste will be worth it. This is also the place for sampling good-old Polish home cooking, as Stara Zajezdnia cooks up dishes such as pork schnitzel and pierogi (dumplings stuffed with meat or cheese) at a cracking price.After getting a feel for Krakow city, it\u2019s time to bite the bullet and visit Auschwitz in otherwise-unremarkable O\u015bwi\u0119cim, west of Krakow. Touring the site of the systematic extermination of 1.1 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and Soviet prisoners of war is never going to be easy, but it\u2019s a deeply emotional and thought-provoking experience. A guided tour of the museum reveals austere prison blocks, the execution yard, and the only remaining solitary gas chamber, standing silent witness to the hundreds of thousands who died there. At Birkenau you\u2019ll spot the iconic railway arch through which cramped trains brought throngs of unsuspecting prisoners to their deaths; at the far end of the decaying rows of wooden barracks there\u2019s a stone memorial that provides the only flicker of hope in this devastating reminder of the Holocaust.Fryderyk Chopin is Poland\u2019s best-loved composer and an uplifting evening unwinding to his tinkling piano concertos is one of the best after-dark activities you can opt for in Krakow. Regular concerts are held in a 16th-century Gothic-paneled hall in the elegant Bonerowski Palace on the Rynek."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "58044ec9fc346a87b95fa3c4"}, "Leeds England, United Kingdom ": "\nLeeds, a city in West Yorkshire, England, was one of the leading centers of industry in Victorian England. The Leeds City Museum is a great place to brush up on local history, and many TripAdvisor travelers say no visit to town is complete without exploring the Royal Armouries. You\u2019ll also find lovely parks and a lively restaurant scene, with many eateries specializing in international cuisine.\nThe Victoria Quarter \u2014 the centre of Leeds\u2019 top-end shopping \u2014 is housed in a series of four ornate, elegant arcades, glittering with stained glass, wrought-ironwork, and marble-tiled flooring. The VQ fell into disrepair in the late 20th century before being restored to its considerable splendor in the early 1990s. Today, it's home to more than 70 boutiques and the exclusive Harvey Nichols department store, making it the first place you should head to sample the city\u2019s booming retail delights. Along with big names such as Vivienne Westwood, Louis Vuitton, Mulberry, Space NK and Charbonnel & Walker, the VQ has plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes for pit stops during shopping sprees.The Corn Exchange is another of Leeds\u2019 spectacular shopping experiences, located in a circular Victorian landmark under an architecturally spectacular dome. It was designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and completed in 1864, one of Britain\u2019s finest Grade 1-listed Victorian buildings. As its name suggests, this was originally the city\u2019s grain market, but nowadays its three stories are adorned with wrought-ironwork balconies and staircases, with each of its 33 shops nestled behind an arched doorway. Known for its small, independent boutiques, the shopping at the Corn Exchange offers delights such as vintage clothing, handmade jewelry, organic soaps, and imported woodwork from Indonesia.The oldest pub in Leeds opened in 1715 in a row of Georgian artisan cottages. Inside, its narrow confines are awash with Victorian brass, copper counters, engraved mirrors and sea-green-meets-yellow tiling. Whitelocks is renowned for its well-curated Yorkshire beers and down-to-earth classic pub dishes, such as fish and chips or beef and ale pie, but it's most famous for its delicious Sunday roasts served with gigantic Yorkshire pudding. There\u2019s even a little beer garden outside for lunch on sunny days.A fortune has been poured into revitalizing Leeds\u2019 industrial heritage to great effect but the jewel in the city\u2019s crown is undoubtedly the Royal Armouries. The UK\u2019s impressive national collection of weapons and armour was moved here from the Tower of London in 1996. It\u2019s housed in a contemporary glass museum overlooking the River Aire and offers six themed displays exhibiting over 8,500 arms and artifacts covering two millennia. Highlights of the collection include swords based on the epic Lord of the Rings, elephant armour, and King Henry VIII\u2019s outsized breast plates.The best Thai restaurant in Leeds is located close to the railway station and is a lavish setting for an Asian feast, kitted out in minimalist style and romantic, shady corners. Service is cheery and smooth. Delicacies include superb tempura prawns and the signature dish of weeping tiger sirloin steak.Founded in 1152 and often overlooked in favour of other great monastic ruins in Yorkshire, Kirkstall is in fact one of the most intact Cistercian abbeys still in existence. Although it has been swallowed up into the suburbs of Leeds, the abbey has a glorious location in parkland overlooking the River Aire. Thriving for centuries, the abbey escaped major damage in the dissolution of the monasteries under King Henry VIII in 1539, when it was taken over for agricultural use. Today its haunting cloisters, colonnaded nave, chapter houses and sacristy still remain from the original 12th-century monastery. Parts of the great central tower collapsed in 1779 however, and the building stayed overgrown and abandoned until the early 20th century, when remedial work was done on the ruins and the abbey was opened to the public.Abbey House Museum is found in the former gatehouse of Kirkstall Abbey and provides a fascinating glimpse into the social impact of the Industrial Revolution in Victorian times, when the textile industry boomed in Yorkshire. Thanks to ample grazing land for sheep in the surrounding countryside and the fast-flowing waters of the River Aire, Leeds exploded in size as rural dwellers moved into the city to work in the mills, and many country villages were all but abandoned. In the museum are three carefully recreated Victorian streets \u2013 complete with shops, chapel and pub \u2013 highlighting the gap in living standards between the poor and wealthy, and featuring a range of housing from a detached mansion to terraced slum dwellings.This sparsely furnished and glass-fronted trattoria is beloved by Leeds in-the-know folk for its small plates of Italian tapas \u2013 boccone \u2013 such as arancini rice balls, buffalo mozzarella and tomato pizzette (mini pizzas). With prices starting at less than a fiver, Zucco is just the place for a light lunch accompanied by a cold glass of Sardinian white wine.World-famous for his monumental, abstract bronze sculptures, Henry Moore was born in Yorkshire in 1898 and despite his success, ploughed much of his money back into this venue for the study of sculpture. Established in 1977, the Henry Moore Institute is located behind a black granite fa\u00e7ade in the Leeds \u2018Cultural Quarter\u2019 and houses three light and airy galleries of changing exhibitions of contemporary sculpture. Recent contributors have included Sir Anthony Caro.Leeds\u2019 Victorian heritage is plain for all to see in the masterly design of its premier theatre. The Grand Theatre opened in 1878, complete with a red plush, semi-circular auditorium adorned with intricate gilt work and topped by a soaring and gaily painted dome. Each season brings a mixed-bag repertoire of drama here, from Agatha Christie mysteries to The Shawshank Redemption, as well as opera and touring West End musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Hairspray.Hansa\u2019s award-wining vegetarian Gujarati dishes have been taking Leeds by storm since 1986. In a stylish venue with an open kitchen \u2013 no flock wallpaper to be seen here \u2013 Hansa serves up beautifully executed cuisine and dishes elegantly presented in a series of thalis, with curries accompanied by delicately flavored rices and chapatis, daals, and dosas. This is modern Indian cooking at its very best.Time to escape to the country! There\u2019s so much to do and see among the beautiful, rolling uplands of the Yorkshire Dales that a mix-and-match itinerary is suggested. Fans of ancient ruins can visit Skipton Castle, Bolton Abbey by the side of the River Wharfe, or the photogenic remains of Fountains Abbey and the adjacent Georgian gardens at Studley Royal. Picturesque villages include Burnsall and Middleham; while the market towns Hawes, Grassington and Leyburn have antique shops, classy boutiques and delis selling local produce. Hikers and cyclists are well catered for too, with numerous footpaths to explore, including the Six Dales Walk; and natural wonders galore, including Aysgarth Falls, Malham Tarn and the sweeping valley of Wensleydale.One of the most mysterious natural phenomena in the Yorkshire Dales, Brimham Rocks are ancient limestone formations laid down by ice and wind erosion millions of years ago. Set amid wild heather moorland and soaring up to 100 feet (30 meters) in height, some of the rocks balance precariously on top of each other, while others are named 'Dancing Bear,' 'Eagles' and even 'Gorilla' for their fantastical natural shapes.Harewood House is one of the finest stately homes in the UK, owned by the aristocratic Lascelles family, who are relations of Her Majesty the Queen. It is exceptional for being the combined handiwork of some of the greatest names in Georgian design: local architect John Carr designed the house in the mid-18th-century in Palladian style, with a symmetrical, colonnaded fa\u00e7ade; Robert Adam created the ornate interior and filled the endless state rooms with priceless S\u00e8vres china and furniture by Chippendale, adorning the walls with Renaissance paintings and portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds; and finally, Capability Brown landscaped the park and the terraced gardens surrounding the house. Today the grounds boast a bird garden \u2013 complete with comical penguins \u2013 and an adventure playground, as well as lakeside walks and walled gardens to explore.A staple on the north Leeds dining scene for many years, the Flying Pizza is a raucous, casual Italian that is a favourite of local celebs and football players. After a sleek overhaul with lots of glass and cheery yellow seating, it still maintains an atmosphere of gentle pandemonium. Rammed on most evenings \u2013 and weekend lunches \u2013 this is a place where dishes fly out of the kitchen but the food is as good as ever. Choose from pizza and pasta, still at a decent price despite the restaurant\u2019s massive popularity, or go upmarket with fillet steaks or sea bass. There\u2019s a decent Italian wine list and a little terrace outside too."}, {"The Hague, Netherlands ": "\nIn a quirky Dutch-ism, Amsterdam may be the official capital of the Netherlands, but it\u2019s The Hague (Den Haag) where the government sits (along with several international courts, for which the city\u2019s best known).

It's a paradise of Mudejar architecture and tranquil palm-tree- and fountain-filled gardens. It also gains modern-day fame having served as a set for the hit TV series Game of Thrones.Apart from having the distinction of being the third-largest church in the world, the Seville Cathedral is also home to what is believed to be the remains of Christopher Columbus. Go there to check out the showy catafalque dedicated to the explorer, or simply to appreciate the cathedral's grand size and notable Gothic style.For the most classic view of Seville, you'll want to scale its most famous tower, the Giralda, which was originally built as a minaret in the 1100s. It's a tiring climb to the top, but the wide ramps instead of stairs make the journey a little more doable, and all the more worthwhile.Plan to inevitably get lost in this neighborhood that is so emblematic of Seville. Formerly the city's Jewish quarter, Santa Cruz is a tangle of streets filled with yellow- and tile-trimmed buildings and dotted by tiny, orange-blossom-tree-shaded plazas.Escape Seville's cluster of streets by heading due south to the expansive Maria Luisa Park. This botanical garden is a paradise of plants, paths, birds, fountains, monuments, and giant, shade-providing trees. It's literally a breath of fresh air in the sometimes-stifling city heat.Created for the Ibero-American exposition in 1929, Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is the place to go to see Seville tile and ceramic goodness in all its glory. That's because the canal-cut and bridge-crossed plaza is bedecked in the vibrantly hued, locally made handiwork. Take special note of the scenes depicted along the square's perimeter, which represent provinces from across the country (hence the name \"Spain Plaza\").Have you ever heard of the opera Carmen? It was inspired by the city's former Royal Tobacco Factory, which once had a women-based workforce and resided in what is now the University of Seville. Visit the school's campus to check out the architecture, reminisce about the musical, or just to enjoy the academic atmosphere.

In the heart of the Italian port city lies Piazza de Ferrari, a main square with a beautiful fountain and a perimeter lined with historic buildings, including the Palace of the Doges the Teatro Carlo Felice, which was destroyed during WWII and subsequently rebuilt. The seaside neighborhood of Boccadasse is vision of pink and yellow buildings that brighten up this lovely fishing village.\nKick off your trip in the buoyant and stimulating heart of the city. After years of abandonment and carelessness, Genoa's old quarter is once again the nucleus of the city, boasting a massive number of sites declared by UNESCO as part of World Heritage. It lies between the Carignano hill in the eastern part of the city and the train station of Porta Principe, just behind the port. Entrenched in the architecture and aesthetics of the timeworn passageways lies a charisma matched only by a few other Italian boroughs.Genoa's most extravagant street, and historically the residential district of the Genoese aristocracy, Via Garibaldi is a timeless display of 16th century residences and mansions, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, open staircases, and patios dominating lavish gardens. Once named the 'golden street' and also 'strada nuova,' this 250-meter long avenue is also known by art lovers for being the most iconic museum artery in town.A superb display of 114 palaces \u2014 of which 42 have been entered into the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 2006 \u2014 this exquisite ensemble was built by the Genoese nobility and used to accommodate people of high rank visiting the city in the period of the Maritime Republic. There are many places of interest to visit such as Palazzo Doria Spinola and The Ducal Palace, both of which are splendid examples of noble architecture.After all the art immersion of the first part of your day, you'll probably fancy some refreshments and a savory snack. In Genoa there is a first-rate bakery on almost every corner, and Fratelli Klainguti is an institution among these. We are very close to the old port area, once visited by crowds before boarding their ships, which is used today mainly for strolling and entertainment purposes. Nevertheless, among all the back and forth of the masses and ubiquitous colorful shops, it's almost impossible not to notice this place: massive, elegant windows, crystal chandeliers, and the charm of 1828 perpetuated generation after generation.The bird-eye view over the elderly heart of 'La Superba' (Genoa was labeled as such by Petrarca) is yours to enjoy once up on the observation deck. Castelletto is a residential neighborhood located on the hills, which takes its name from a fort that dominated the center of the city until its demolition in the second half of the 19th century. Also known as the 'Belvedere Luigi Montaldo,' it boasts 360 degree views of the old port, the palaces of Via Garibaldi (the old Strada Nuova,) the promontory of Portofino in the east, up to the foothills of the Italian-French border of Ventimiglia.The antique tradition of cooking with simple essences and natural aromas has not been forgotten for a single moment in beautiful Liguria. Just 20 meters away from the acclaimed Piazza de Ferrari, the Rosmarino specializes in seafood cuisine and offers traditional dishes presented in a fashionable and clear-cut manner. One of the rooms has an open kitchen, while the precise and discreet staff describes the dishes and offers suggestions and advice.Alternating black and white layers and two friendly lions emerging from the sides will let you know that you have arrived in front of Genoa's Cathedral, located in San Lorenzo square. A quick analysis will reveal a conglomerate of different styles \u2014 the fanciful Gothic carvings will thrill you, while the 14th century frescoes in the Byzantine style from inside the church will intrigue you. Moreover, parts of the original building dating back to the 12th century blend with newfangled 20th century cement chunks. The Museum of the Treasury lies in the underground rooms of the cathedral and displays various religious objects, among which the supposedly Holy Grail used by Christ Himself during the Last Supper.As a tourist in today's Genoa's Porto Antico, you are just spoiled for choice. In 1992, to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America, and with the help of the brilliant mind of the world-renowned Genoese architect Renzo Piano (also responsible for Paris' Pompidou Center,) the old port of Genoa was born afresh. The tourism renaissance that followed is rightfully justified, as the old port hosts a considerable number of attractions in Genoa today.Conveniently situated in the very touristy area of the old port of Genoa, the aquarium was inaugurated in 1992 and has since become the town's leading attraction.

A conspicuous sea-mark since it was rebuilt in 1543, Genoa's lighthouse is almost 120 meters above sea level and relishes the title of 'the city's symbol.' In ancient times, apart from its purpose of signaling the position of the port to incoming ships, it also served as a defensive fortress outside the city walls.Built between 1909 and 1915, the 2200 meter long Corso Italia is one of the main roads in Genoa, connecting the neighborhoods of La Foce and Boccadasse.

You can start your trip at the Punta Vagno lighthouse in the district of La Foce and end it in the dazzling old mariners' neighborhood of Boccadasse.You will arrive in the narrow bay of Boccadasse by walking the distance of Corso Italia from the center. The small bay, in which anchored fishing boats dominate the scene in front of pastel little houses squeezed into one another, is a well-known village where the Genoese and tourists flock to savor the quietness and poetry of a space forgotten by time, in the middle of the modern city.Genoa is sea and mountains, highs and lows, exactly like its cuisine. A meal in the Santa Chiara restaurant is a celebration of the culture and lifestyle of the Italian Riviera, where fish occupies an honored place. The setting is comfortable and exclusive, perfect for an elegant dinner in front of an arresting vista of the sea, the beach, and the village of Boccadasse .There is a place in Genoa where my pores shimmer under a wavering light, where my thoughts drift to and fro above the sea currents, as I give my feet a rest and face the inexhaustible horizon. This place is a two kilometer long promenade overlooking the sea, precisely between the Parks of Nervi and the sea, situated in the residential district of Genoa Nervi \u2014 heading East from the center of Genoa. The utterly romantic walkway was built taking advantage of the paths along the coast already used by fishermen and farmers, and is endowed with the powerful quality of giving you goosebumps.Genoa is, in many of its parts, a quest of verticality. The best way to counter this and to get from the busy core of the city to a blissfully placid paradise 300 meters above sea level, is the cable car Zecca - Righi. It connects the Largo della Zecca, a square in the heart of the historical center, very close to Via Garibaldi and the museums in Strada Nuova, to the hilly district of Righi. There is only one binary that splits up halfway through, more precisely in the station of St. Nicholas, only to allow the simultaneous passage of the ascending cabin and the descending one.Ernest Hemingway described this open-air museum as 'one of the wonders of the world' after walking along its monumental arcades. Reputed to be one of the most important cemeteries in Europe, the burial ground is located in the Val Bisagno, a district of Genoa close to the mountains just behind the city. There are beautiful examples of various architectural styles (Gothic, Art Nouveau, Byzantine, neo-classical,) monuments with which the Genoese bourgeoisie of the 1800s flaunted their wealth by honoring their dead at the same time. In addition to the Christian cemetery, the graveyard also houses an English cemetery, a Jewish one, and a Protestant one.Whether you are looking for the ultimate food-shopping-experience, a delicious lunch break menu, a sumptuous dinner, or just a snack, this should be your next stop in Genoa.

You can view the ruins from outside, but it's worth going in (entrance is free!) for a close-up look. Take a seat in the theatre itself, and transport yourself back to a time of emperors and gladiators.Malaga's Moorish fortress offers the best vantage point for viewing the city. Although it's not on the same scale as the Alhambra in Granada, Malaga's Alcazaba gives you a good idea of how the Moors built their castles and used mosaics to decorate interiors. You can climb up to many of the towers and admire the views of the city below and the coastline beyond.Known as the one-armed lady (because the second tower was never finished), the Malaga Cathedral dominates the center of the city. Like most Spanish cathedrals, it's huge, with lots of elaborate side altars. Baroque art and decoration dominate, and some of the stained-glass windows are spectacular.

New street art appears almost weekly, so keep an eye out for the latest wall murals.Before you head to Nerja for the day, pop into this lovely indoor market just off the Alameda. The choice of shellfish and fish has to be seen to be believed, and you'll be amazed at the variety of olives on display. Most stalls at Mercado Central de Atarazanas allow you to try before you buy, so make the most of this \u2014 and stock up on presents to take home.About an hour's bus ride from Malaga, Nerja is home to southern Spain's most impressive caves. Discovered quite by chance by some schoolboys in the 1950s, these limestone galleries are home to some amazing stalactites and stalagmites, as well as prehistoric cave paintings.Perched on a cliff in the town of Nerja (a short bus ride from the caves), Balcon de Europa offers unbeatable views of the coastline and the craggy mountains behind it. This is also a great spot for people watching, so grab a bench and watch the world go by.One of Nerja's prettiest sandy coves, Playa de Burriana is a great place to relax after sightseeing.

Get here early in the morning to avoid the heaviest tourist traffic. In the quiet of the morning, you can take your pick from the numerous small cafes that line the alleys, and start your day off with a relaxing cup of coffee.Located right at the heart of Piazza Maggiore, just in front of the main entrance to the Bologna library, this fountain is a popular meeting point for Bolognese locals.

A charming example of Bolognese style, the basilica looks very different from the churches you will find in tourist hot-spots like Florence and Rome, making it well worth exploring while in the Piazza Maggiore area.Via Dell\u2019Indipendenza is the central shopping street leading to the very heart of Bologna. Whatever is on your shopping list, you're likely to find it (and then some) here. The street is home to an impressive array of stores, selling everything from ice cream to clothing to souvenirs.Situated just outside of the old city center, Giardini Margerita is the most popular park in Bologna and is easy to reach on foot. When the sun is out, this park comes alive with couples, small groups of friends, and families sunbathing, enjoying picnics, or just relaxing on a blanket with a good book.La Piccola Venezia ('the small Venice' in English), is a lasting reminder of what Bologna used to look like. While actually just a single canal (meaning visitors who have been to the real Venice may be a little less impressed), it's still worth a detour if you're nearby\u2014and it will help you to better understand the origins of the city.Also known as San Michele in Bosco, Complesso Monumentale is a must-see religious complex. The church itself is beautiful, and the view from the top of the hill is just as magnificent.

The Galleria dell'Accademia bursts with works by Michelangelo, who is entombed within the frescoed walls of the Basilica di Santa Croce. Budding photographers can snap pics of the Ponte Vecchio bridge, and serious shoppers can spend a blissful afternoon wandering the shops of Piazza Santo Spirito. Tuscan cuisine pays homage to the region\u2019s bounty. Swipe a hunk of crusty bread across a pool of local olive oil and you\u2019ll be instantly transported to your happiest place.\nThis is the very heart of Florence: The main church with the famous Cupola by Brunelleschi. The exterior walls are built in different marbles which combine with one another in a captivating game of hues, a style that has given Tuscan cities a most distinguished look throughout the centuries. The building was initiated in the early Italian Renaissance, in the 13th Century, and completed during the high Renaissance period. Although construction and decoration took several hundred years, once you enter and have the chance to admire it in its full splendor, you\u2019ll conclude it was worth the wait!If you want to give chronological sense to your art tour, it is important that you visit this attraction before the others in Piazza Duomo: Il Battistero is a more medieval accomplishment and more faithful in its interiors to earlier style trends. It is entirely decorated in gold and the light reflections are impressive.Behind Piazza Duomo, this taverna has a good selection of local dishes to choose from, and a good wine list. Prices are very reasonable, considering the very central location, and while the food is not high standard or sophisticated cuisine, it is good food on a budget and I would recommend it at least for a quick bite. My personal favorite here is the 'pasta e ceci' with 'lardo di colonnata' - a typical Tuscan dish.This museum is located directly behind the Duomo and contains the major oeuvres relating to the buildings surrounding the square. It gives visitors a very good background on how the famous Florentine buildings were constructed, as well as playing host to some of the most prominent Renaissance artworks. My personal favorite is Michelangelo\u2019s Florentine Piet\u00e0. Although the one mostly referred to is situated in the Vatican museums in Rome, the one you'll find here is definitely worthy of attention, too. It is a later work by a more mature Michelangelo. The sculpture represents the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Nicodemus holding Jesus as they take him down from the cross. The young Michelangelo is apparently also represented by Jesus himself, who is sculpted with a remarkably more vigorous and robust body than its counterpart in the Vatican.It\u2019s 85 meters tall, and of course, I took the stairs all the way up, which is exactly what I advise other visitors to do! The reward at the top? Florence \u2014 the view of the entire cityscape in all its glorious colors and gentle forms. It makes for a memorable experience.Possibly the most important museum in the city. If you are an art lover, you have found Mecca. This gallery includes works by Michelangelo, Botticelli and Da Vinci, to name but a few...This unique gallery is located near Piazza San Marco, and it's famed for hosting the original statue of David by Michelangelo. (The most photographed version in Piazza della Signoria, is, in fact, a replica.)Florence is not a metropolis by any standard: It is a fairly small city, easily toured on foot and not overpopulated. Still, the sheer amount of art it contains is overwhelming, and exploring it all makes for hungry work. If a delicious Florentine steak (when in Florence!) is just what your appetite is craving, Buca Lapi is the place for you. The atmosphere is warm, the smells are sensational, and the steaks are perfectly cooked, rare and served in generous portions.One of my favorite churches: Its colors are vivid and you get an immediate sense of harmony and peace when you venture inside. The main attractions here are the Crucifix by Giotto, Masaccio's Holy Trinity and the Crucifix by Brunelleschi.This Basilica is located a little outside the city center and therefore tends not to be as crowded as the other churches in Florence. Reaching the building preceded by incredibly steep steps is an experience in itself, and attention must be paid to the church's stunning mosaic decoration.Head to Ponte Vecchio on foot and explore this ancient photogenic bridge, first built in Roman times, and then rebuilt in the Middle Ages. It crosses the Arno River and makes for an evocative stroll.This is a great local place for good local food at a good price, situated near to the outdoor market. Tripe, a most popular Florentine dish, is one of their specialties, and the ribollita is delicious, too. Ribollita consists of a chunky soup whose main ingredient is usually cannellini beans, also very typical of the area."}, {"Bilbao, Spain ": "\nTravelers generally come to Bilbao to see the Guggenheim\u2014some for the art inside, but many for the amazing building itself.

It's an eclectic maze of shops and restaurants, bars and cafes. Charcuteries and fishmongers rub shoulders with pastry windows and cheese shops, while boutiques stock unique fashions, accessories, and gifts. Tool around to window shop, people watch, and grab a bite to eat. (It is packed with market stalls and terraces spilling onto the sidewalk by lunchtime.) This rustic hodgepodge is must-see territory, enjoyed by tourists and locals alike, and a good spot by which to navigate many of Nice's other sites.Cours Saleya features many of Old Town's best shops and outdoor stalls. During market days, it erupts into life with people buying and selling bouquets of flowers, ripe fruit, and local vegetables. The restaurants and cafes in the area are packed and popular, with stiff cups of espresso and fresh seafood catches on offer. It's a great place to stop for a warm pick-me-up or a cool drink and get energized for your day, to the tune of hawkers and smell of the sea air.The Promenade des Anglais is one of the city's best strolling spots. You can amble your way here from Cours Saleya \u2014 one of many starting points, as the Promenade intersects with much of Nice \u2014 making it either a convenient detour or a lovely way to get to your next destination. With the seafront in the distance, dotted with white canopies, this scenic route offers lanes for you to cycle, jog, rollerblade; or simply take your time, have a drink, and even grab a spot of street-side ice cream.Set just off of the Promenade des Anglais is the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire at the Palais Massena. The small, sumptuous palace is nestled into a set of lovely gardens, but the real treat lies inside. Grand, embellished rooms are home to a series of exhibits which tell the story of Nice's past through drawings, paintings, photos, and city artifacts \u2014 from the Napoleonic era through to the 20th-century. Its anecdotes about the people who lived in Nice are especially unique to the Palais, and its gift shop always has interesting gift and souvenir items.Place Massena used to be the spot of choice for the rich and noble in Nice. The square still attests to this sumptuous past, with arched buildings, checkered sidewalks, playful fountains, and ornate statues. The streets surrounding the beautiful Place Massena are where you will find a lot of Nice's caf\u00e9 culture, some great photo opportunities, and a generally upbeat vibe that invites you to take advantage of a bit of shopping or to dine in local style.While you are still in the vicinity of Old Town, the Palais de Justice makes for a photogenic stop for architecture lovers. The old court house has magnificent reliefs, and by day, lawyers and newlyweds can be seen milling about it. Perhaps surprisingly, it's also a good spot to get your night going, as the surrounding streets house some of the city's most popular bars.The Monument aux Morts is a stunning tribute to France's soldiers. Massive and visually arresting, it houses the dog tags of France's 20th-century war casualties in a stunning remembrance of their sacrifice. Located overlooking Nice's harbor and the sea, and well-lit by nightfall, the memorial is set into stone, very close to Castle Hill, and well worth visiting.Beside Monument aux Morts, Castle Hill boasts impressive views of Nice's azure harbor and the ochre rooftops of the city itself. Wonderful for a small hike, a picnic, or even a coffee at the hilltop caf\u00e9, Castle Hill is suitable for any type of visitor, boasting a children's play area, as well as an elevator, for ease of getting up and down the hill.Te Basilique Notre-Dame de Nice is a beautiful little basilica situated in a local part of town. The Gothic architecture, reliefs, and stained glass make it a stunning sight to behold, as do its rustic wooden seats, ornate archways, and embellished facade. While it may not merit a trip if you're nowhere near here, it makes for a nice stop if you are already in the vicinity \u2014 especially as there are numerous well-priced cafes and eateries in the area, where you can rest and refuel after.Place Garibaldi is a dynamic mix of strolling arcades and outdoor caf\u00e9s, back near Place Massena. It has a sublime sense of community, crowded with locals grabbing breakfast or lunch, and is well-located close to the harbor and Rue Bonaparte. Stop by to grab a meal in the sunshine, or enjoy the children's play areas and flower gardens. Place Garibaldi is pedestrian-only, so it's also a nice break from traffic, though important tram and bus lines do run near it, making it an easy stop.Within Old Town, the Cathedrale Sainte-Reparte is small but charming, and contains some significant pieces of religious art. The 16th-century cathedral, dedicated to a young martyr, is home to a lovely triple nave and transept layout within its chapel, and its facade bears the only official visual likeness of St. Valerius in the world. The chapel includes informational plaques about the art that embellishes its walls and windows, both inside and out, painting a full story for visitors.Ending an evening with a good meal is a must in France! At Le Comptoir du Marche, located along an agreeable little street with only foot traffic, visitors can sit down to a modern French meal. The menu changes seasonally, propped up by fresh local ingredients, and generous portion sizes. Excellent service and a sprawling wine list complete the meal!The Monastere de Cimiez, located close to both the Roman ruins and the Matisse Museum, is a handsome old church with a hand painted ceiling. Serene, with an inspiring vista over the city from its grounds, the monastery has three major highlights for visitors: Its lush gardens, where you can enjoy the peace and quiet; the three decorative retables painted by 16th-century artist Louis Brea; and the cemetery in which Henri Matisse and his wife are buried.The garden at the Cimiez Monastery is verdant and ethereal. Though small, it bears striking views of Nice from its edges, and its flower-studded walks can provide a much-needed breather from the bustle of the city center. Its roses are especially wonderful, draped over archways and snaking up walls, perfuming the air. (It gives new meaning to 'stop and smell the roses!')At the Musee National Marc Chagall, the artist's life and important works are celebrated. The museum is home to all seventeen of Chagall's colorful Biblical message tableaux's, as well as some of his most impressive tapestries.

At Musee Matisse on Cimiez Hill, the artist who called C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur home from 1917 until his death in 1954, is celebrated at a 17th-century villa which houses some of his lesser-known works. The museum is easygoing and very walkable, featuring pieces of Matisse's art from 1890 to the 1940s, offering a comprehensive sampling of his work. While it may not be home to his most famous pieces, it's a wonderful spot to see the evolution of his style, and the impact that the World Wars had on it. It also includes objects from his daily life and apartment that cannot be found elsewhere.The Ancien Hotel Regina, which is now home to some of Nice's most attractive apartments, was once in use as a hotel. Created specifically for the use of the English Queen Victoria, the Regina is still worth visiting to marvel at the architecture that so quickly went up to celebrate the Queen's six-week stays in the late 1800s. Located on Cimiez Hill, close to the Matisse Museum, the Regina also happens to have been home to Matisse himself.

It was and still is the See of the Archbishop of Utrecht, the most important Catholic leader in the Netherlands. The University of Utrecht is the largest in the Netherlands. One of the unique features of the city is the wharf system in its inner canals. Before the city was fully canalized, parts of the Rhine River flowed through the city center.

You can view the ruins from outside, but it's worth going in (entrance is free!) for a close-up look. Take a seat in the theatre itself, and transport yourself back to a time of emperors and gladiators.Malaga's Moorish fortress offers the best vantage point for viewing the city. Although it's not on the same scale as the Alhambra in Granada, Malaga's Alcazaba gives you a good idea of how the Moors built their castles and used mosaics to decorate interiors. You can climb up to many of the towers and admire the views of the city below and the coastline beyond.Known as the one-armed lady (because the second tower was never finished), the Malaga Cathedral dominates the center of the city. Like most Spanish cathedrals, it's huge, with lots of elaborate side altars. Baroque art and decoration dominate, and some of the stained-glass windows are spectacular. Look out for some fine works of art \u2014 although a few are rather graphic, so be prepared for the odd gruesome sight!A great spot for a bite to eat between monuments, El Pimpi has terraces overlooking the Roman Theatre and the Alcazaba. These aren't the best tapas in Malaga, but the fast and friendly service, along with the great location, make El Pimpi a good stop for refueling in between sights.You could probably do with a spot of relaxation after taking in Malaga's main historic sights, and these authentic Moorish baths fit the bill.

The medieval overtones of Bruges\u2019 cobblestone streets lead to countless historical, architectural and artistic wonders. Marvel at ornate houses lining intricate canals, and understand why this is a favorite destination for all types of travelers. The whole city emanates an appreciation of the past, a love of the present, and enthusiasm for the future. Don\u2019t miss Hof Bladelin, Groeninge Museum, Church of Our Lady, and Belfry and Market Halls.\nVisitors to Bruges can orient themselves to the city by taking a boat trip around the canals: Float past medieval palaces and warehouses, glimpse the Belfry tower, and duck under bridges. There are five departure points, with the two along Dijver being closest to the great central piazzas of Markt and Burg.The heart of Bruges lies in the Markt, the vast square surrounded by gabled medieval palaces and dominated by the Belfry, which is the city\u2019s most iconic landmark and dates in part back to 1240. The ornate central tower is the tallest in Belgium; on a clear day it is possible to see the coast from the top. The lower floors of the Belfry, originally the city\u2019s trading halls, are now given over to the Museum-Gallery Xpo Dal\u00ed for a suitably eccentric retrospective of Spain\u2019s famous surrealist artist. The city\u2019s main tourist office is housed in a wonderfully ornate Gothic Revivalist palace opposite the Belfry, and the square is lined with typically Flemish eateries with seats under colorful awnings.A relative newcomer on the Bruges cultural circuit, the Historium sits above the tourist office in the Markt, and it's the best place to start an exploration of the city. Through interactive displays, film, music, and holograms, the history of Bruges\u2019s 15th century heyday is brought to life in an entertaining and educational way.The second of Bruges\u2019s great central squares is steps away from the Markt and showcases some of the most beautiful medieval palaces in Belgium, which were mostly civic buildings. Masterpieces include the Palace of the Liberty of Bruges, which was formerly the city\u2019s law court, and its over-blown 16th-century council chambers. The gilded Stadhuis (Town Hall) next door was built in 1376 and is the oldest administrative building in Belgium. Its fa\u00e7ade is decorated with replicas of statues by Jan van Eyck and inside, the Gothic Hall is adorned with glowing, gilded 19th-century murals depicting highlights from the city\u2019s turbulent history.The Basilica of the Holy Blood squats next to the Stadhuis in the corner of the Burg, a 12th-century Romanesque chapel with Gothic upper floors. The exterior is colonnaded and covered with lacy arches, the interior is of mind-boggling richness, and there is a small ecclesiastical museum to explore too. The church houses a much-revered relic of Christ in the form of a cloth smeared in his blood, reputedly wiped from his body by Joseph of Arimathea after the Crucifixion.There are more than 700 beers brewed in Belgium, from fruit, white, and wheat beers to monastery-brewed Trappist ales, lagers, strong dubbels, tripels, and yeasty lambic beers. The Beer Museum provides a high-tech overview of the growth of the brewing industry in Bruges, nattily guided by iPad, also educating visitors on the various types of ale and explaining how to pair beers with food. Visitors learn about beer provenance through touchscreens, and the tour ends in the tasting room, where there is plenty of opportunity to sample several unusual beers.By early evening, the caf\u00e9s of the Markt and Burg are well and truly buzzing; now is the time for an aperitif before heading here to Breydel-De Coninc for a blowout seafood supper of shellfish, lobster, and the favorite Flemish waterzoo\u00ef stew with fish and vegetables in a creamy sauce. Named after Flemish heroes Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck, who led an uprising against the city\u2019s wealthy rulers in 1302, the restaurant has a simple interior with stripped pine floors and wooden tables, and it's one of the best fish restaurants in Bruges. Prices can be accordingly high, although the pails of mussels is good value for money.In a light-flooded gallery built in the late 1920s, the Groeninge stands among Belgium\u2019s premier art museums, with a specialist collection of Flemish masterpieces from the 15th to the 20th centuries. Highlights include works by Flemish Primitive artists Jan van Eyck, Hieronymus Bosch, and Hans Memling, and the story continues with portraits by Sir Anthony van Dyck, the romantic paintings of James Ensor, and a sterling collection from homegrown Belgian Surrealists Paul Delvaux and Ren\u00e9 Magritte. Almost next door to the Groeningemuseum is the Gothic Gruuthuse, a lavishly appointed mansion built by a 15th-century nobleman who obviously lived in some considerable style. The vast courtyard and decorative doorways prepare the way for the opulent interior, adorned with elaborately carved fireplaces, oak balconies and gilded wooden ceilings. Set against this splendid background is a fine assembly of silverware, ceramics, glassware and tapestries showcasing the very best of 15th-century Flemish decorative arts.The earliest wards in the Sint-Janshospitaal (Hospital of St John) date back to the 13th century, and did not close until 1976. Inside there\u2019s a 17th-century apothecary still displaying rows of glass medicine bottles and medieval hospital wards filled with stomach-turning surgical instruments. However the highlight of a visit is the religious artwork by Flemish Primitive Hans Memling, who was one of Bruges\u2019s most prominent artists in the 15th century. Displayed in the hospital\u2019s former chapel, his masterpieces include the gleaming, golden Ursula Shrine and a sublime three-paneled altarpiece. Also housed in the former wards of the Hospital of St John, the Expo Bruges is an oft-overlooked modern-art museum that offers a wander through Impressionism to Picasso, with a collection of several hundred sketches, lithographs and prints by the likes of Monet and Rodin, Magritte and Mir\u00f3.The Begijnhof sits in a tranquil grassy courtyard planted with trees. It was founded in 1245 for women who vowed to remain celibate, but without taking religious vows. For centuries, the Beguines were responsible for caring for the sick and injured in St John\u2019s Hospital. Today the Begijnhof is run by Benedictine nuns and its neat lines of gabled, whitewashed houses still have an air of calm that is rare in tourist-packed Bruges; one of the houses contains a small museum relating the history of the Beguines, who left their historic home as recently as 1976.As one of Bruges\u2019s few remaining family-owned breweries, the Half Moon has operated on its present site since 1856 and now offers tours of its former brewhouse. The brewery still produces its notorious Brugse Zot (Bruges Fool) and extra-strong Straffe Hendrik. Both can be sampled in the smart on-site brasserie, which has a pretty courtyard for impromptu summer-afternoon beer tastings.De Vier Winden is virtually at the foot of the Belfry on the Markt, and prices are amazingly good for views of this caliber, especially when the tower is romantically floodlit at night. The cooking may not be haute cuisine but the standard is consistently good, and the cheap meal deals of mussels, seafood platters, and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e never lets its punters down.Belgians are besotted with chocolate; Choco-Story nips through the coca bean\u2019s history, from its origins among the Mayans, to hot chocolate becoming the tipple of choice among Europe\u2019s aristocracy in the 1500s, to a look at modern-day production processes. With lots of Aztec artifacts and Limoges china to admire, the exhibition continues through to chocolate-making displays and a chance to taste the finished product.Like chocolate, fries are something of a national obsession in Belgium, served thin and sprinkled with salt. So it\u2019s only appropriate that a museum dedicated to the humble spud has opened in Bruges. It\u2019s housed in the 14th-century Gothic Saaihaile and delivers hard facts about the potato from its origins in Peru to the Irish Potato Famine; and there\u2019s an entertaining film about the progress of the spud from seed to frozen fry. Visitors of course have a chance to sample the wares at the end of the tour!In the 15th century there were more than 2,000 lace makers in Bruges, so hats off to the ladies at the Lace Center, who are determined to pass their dying craft on to the next generation. Part workshop and part museum, this is the place to go to see intricately patterned lace shawls and tablecloths flying off the bobbins at the daily demonstrations between 2pm and 5pm. Of course, there\u2019s inevitably an opportunity to purchase lace at the end of a visit, and although prices are steep, at least visitors can be assured that all the lace here is handmade.With chandeliers glinting in the candlelight, Le Chef et Moi \u2014 a romantic little restaurant featuring a tiny menu showcasing seasonal ingredients \u2014 is fast becoming the go-to destination on the Bruges dining scene. Owner-chef Stefaan Cardinael cooks up a storm \u2014 dishes include scallops, sole, venison, and a signature ginger and hazlenut cheesecake \u2014 while his partner Caroline Saeys oversees the fine wine list.

Give them a try, you won't regret it!This used to be the main pier here in Brighton, but after becoming derelict and falling into disrepair, it was set alight in 2003 (many believe this to be an arson attack), and now it's just slowly crumbling into the sea.

It's mainly high street names such as H&M;, Debenhams and Apple, but you can also find a few independent stores as well as little stalls within the mall too.Serving bagels, soups and falafels, Bagelman is legendary in Brighton and is worth a lunchtime or early afternoon stop.

It's a beast!\"The Lanes\" refers to the area bounded by North Street to the north, Ship Street to the west, Prince Albert Street to the south and Market Street to the east.

Sure, you could attempt to conjure up this elegant city by reading Pride and Prejudice in your tub, but as Bath has a lot more history than your bathroom (we assume, anyway) you'd be missing out. A stroll through Bath is like visiting an open-air museum, with roughly 5,000 buildings in the city drawing notice for their architectural merit. After your stroll, soak in the natural hot waters of the Thermae Bath Spa, once a favorite of the Celts and Romans.\nA good caffeine fix to kick start your time in Bath, and conveniently located between both bus and train stations. Great lattes, freshly made sweet and savory bites, and friendly staff makes Jika Jika a great first stop.An absolute must for anyone visiting Bath. A historic and iconic landmark of Bath's history, revelers are taken six meters below street level to see sights such as the Sacred Spring and the Roman Temple. The baths are undoubtedly one of the city's most popular attractions, and lines build up very quickly. In short, the earlier you arrive, the better. The costumed characters add a nice touch to the tour, particularly for families traveling with children.It is impossible to visit Bath without encountering one of the city's grandest landmarks. A fine example of Gothic architecture, the Abbey is not merely a church, it also serves as a signpost back to the city centre, should you ever get lost. The interior of the Abbey is far more striking than the pictures suggest, and for those feeling particularly fit, the 212 stairs to the top of the Tower should hit the spot. Needless to say, the views of Bath from the Tower are well worth the sweat beads. The many benches dotted around the Abbey also provide ample opportunity for one of my favourite pastimes: people watching.There is surely nothing more satisfying than a sugar rush after burning off a few hundred calories checking out the city's sights. The San Francisco Fudge Factory sells a fine range of handmade, gluten free, creamy fudge, in a wide variety of flavours. I am particularly partial to the salted caramel fudge and the cocoa dusted chili truffles.A short hop, skip and a jump away from Bath Abbey is the very pretty Parade Gardens. A lovely patch of circular green, the gardens add to the tranquility typically associated with Bath. Those lucky to visit in summer can inspect the sights from street level, or enter the park itself.Another hard to miss feature in Bath, the Palladian style bridge crosses over the River Avon, adding a hint of Venetian charm to the city. Shops and cafes are situated along this Grade I listed structure, and views from the bridge offer a different perspective.Carry on walking from Pulteney Bridge and you will find yourself on Bath's widest street. With both sides lined with the Georgian style homes atypical of the city, Great Pulteney Street not only makes for a pleasant walk, but it also leads to another place of interest, the Holburne Museum.Nestled in the Sydney Pleasure Gardens, the Holburne Museum is definitely worth a visit. Bath's first public museum, entry is free (though donations are welcome) and exhibitions range from classic to contemporary. I was fortunate to be there to see several pieces from the Caneletto exhibition being transported inside the building!Begin day two with a visit to one of Bath's most famous attractions: Royal Crescent. Though No. 1 Royal Crescent is a museum, the main attraction is the crescent-shaped formation of Georgian style houses found on this row. This particular Grade I listed building offer views of nearby Victoria Park, and while some of the other houses here are residential, no. 16 is home to the Royal Crescent Hotel.A short walk from the Royal Crescent lies another Bath treasure, The Circus. A circular architectural display of Georgian townhouses, the attraction is a wondrous sight and a particular treat for anyone interested in history, design, and the architecture of John Wood the Elder.Spend an afternoon cruising along the peaceful Kennet & Avon Canal on a traditional narrowboat. Various options for boat hire include full day, half day, and even overnight trips. The boats accommodate 1 to 12 people, and is great value for those wanting to explore the Kennet & Avon Canal and its surrounding countryside. I would recommend bringing a picnic lunch to ensure full stomachs and happy faces; alternatively, Bath Narrowboats can provide a gourmet hamper (if ordered in advance.)The Kennet & Avon Canal is a waterway that covers some of the country's most scenic areas. With many bike paths situated along the canal, cycling is a popular way to explore Bath and its surrounding areas. Despite the unpredictable English weather, I'd still recommend spring/summer to cycle the route.A trip to Bath would not be complete without a visit to Sally Lunn's Historic Eating House. Accept no imitations, as no Bath bun compares to those served here.

There are no words nor pictures that do it justice, you must try it for yourself!It would be a crime to visit Bath, and not sample the very experience that the city takes its historic name from! With many hotels in the city offering spa facilities, the Thermae Bath Spa has gained a popular following, and after my own visit, it is easy to see why. Beautifully maintained historic surroundings, friendly and accommodating staff, and wonderful spa facilities places the Thermae Bath Spa high on my list. Its ethos centres around inclusiveness, meaning that everyone is welcome; it's great value for money, and there are also a range of spa treatments available to book. I myself will be returning soon to try a Watsu massage - a form of Shiatsu massage that takes place in the natural thermal waters of the Hot Bath. The star of the show however, is undeniably the rooftop pool, an experience made even more memorable if you're lucky to experience some sunshine while bathing!Another coffee I hear you say? Yes!

The water in Bagno Vignoni is steamy hot, so bathing here is a great thing to do on a cold afternoon, but even in summer the warm water is somehow refreshing.Lovely Lucca is also an excellent base for your time in Tuscany. There are more than 100 churches to visit, plus music performances almost every night of the year, and plenty of piazzas in which to while a few hours away.This historic bar has been serving coffee since the 1920s. It's well known for its pastries, but you can also come here for an early evening aperitivo.Walking or biking along the four kilometers of paths that ring the city of Lucca is an absolute must during your time in Tuscany. There are shady, tree-lined expanses, grassy areas for picnics, benches for resting, and views out over the mountains and the rooftops.About a 20-minute drive from Lucca, Borgo a Mozzano is worthy of a quick stop for its incredible bridge. The official name is 'Ponte della Maadalena,' but it is also called the 'Ponte del Diavolo,' or the 'Devil's Bridge.' In medieval times, the bridge was an important link in the pilgrim route between France and Rome. Today, it's an incredible example of the period's architectural engineering.Tuscany is not all charming hill towns and rolling hills. It also has about 400 miles of coastline.

Though its connection to the actual Capulets is tenuous at best, the so-called Juliet's House draws half a million tourists per year, many of them keen on reenacting the balcony scene. Don't miss the Roman amphitheater and the Palazzo Barberi.\nOur journey starts in Piazza Bra, the second most important square in the city, and home to the world famous amphitheater, Arena di Verona. After its birth in the first century AD, the Arena went through a series of transformations, as it was used for several different purposes. There was a time when the Roman amphitheater was the place where prostitutes had their headquarters, only to be transformed into an area for selling fruits and vegetables some years later. The first opera concert ever held here was by Verdi, and since then, the Arena has possibly become the most famous place in Italy for opera singers to perform (after La Scala di Milano).All eyes on Via Mazzini now, the most fashionable street in Verona, housing the poshest shops and the biggest theater in town. The street takes its name from Giuseppe Mazzini, one of the most important people to have contributed to the unification of Italy, and there may be no coincidence in the fact that it links the two major squares of Verona: Piazza Bra and Piazza delle Erbe. In this large pedestrian area, you can find luxurious shops and numerous souvenir stores, while the street artists are likely to entertain you with their unique talents. Should you wander into the back alleys, you might also discover some typical bars and pubs, where you can quench your thirst with a tasty Italian aperitivo. Even though this shopping street is mostly high-end, if you come to Verona during the sales you will find some serious discounts here. A lot of shops also offer a discount just before the sale period starts, especially if you put on your best smile and ask!After reaching the end of Via Mazzini, we find ourselves at a crossroad. Here, we turn left into the amazingly elegant Piazza Erbe, with its imposing tower, and lively cafes and bars that celebrate the old buildings above them (on which beautiful frescoes still reign). Some of Verona\u2019s oldest buildings are situated here, as this was the most important gathering place for political and economic life during ancient times. In the center of the square, you can admire the Madonna Verona fountain, which consists of a beautiful Roman statue with an epigraphy dating from the IV century. Just next to the Madonna Verona fountain, you will also notice a covered square pavilion, boasting a strange giant handcuff and some geometrical forms beneath it. This peculiar structure is one of the best-kept secrets of Verona and few people know exactly what purpose it truly served. Contrary to the popular belief that this used to be a place for handcuffing and torturing people, this was actually the heart of Verona\u2019s commerce. People used to get on top of the pavilion and try to sell their merchandise (mostly raw materials, like wood or stone) to anyone interested. In order to prove that their logs of wood were the width they claimed, they used to slip them through a metal cuff which was a standard measurement. The same thing was done with bricks and roof tiles that had to fit the dimensions of the geometrical forms, which you can still see today embossed in the lower part of the edifice.This is a medieval tower that you cannot miss once you are in Piazza delle Erbe. It measures 83 meters (272 feet) in height and dominates the historical center of the city of love. At the beginning of the 1700s, the clock was added to the tower, most probably because the previous mechanical clock, which reigned on top of Torre del Gardello (South-West angle of Piazza Erbe,) had stopped working.Does this even need an introduction? Cappello Street, number 23. Probably the most romantic address in the world, presumed to be the house of Giulietta Capuleti and favorite wooing spot of Romeo Montecchi. Visitors from all over the world, anxious to learn about the place of eternal love, are invited into a small but very welcoming front yard from where they can access the famous house and admire the prominent balcony. Juliet\u2019s bronze statue, created in the 60s by the Veronese sculpture Nereo Costantini, guards the entrance, bearing some lines from the famous Shakespearean tragedy. Legend says that touching the right breast of the bronze statue of Juliet will bring you luck in finding your own true love; however, you will notice that this part of the sculpture has changed color because of the high number of tourists that do this, so please be gentle (the photo will look the same if you only pretend to touch it.)Our day is coming to an end and we will end it in style by having a drink and something to eat at Mazzanti's. This place is just great for anything you could possibly be in the mood for, from a multiple course menu to a traditional Veronese Spritz Aperol to a simple hot chocolate. It is one place where I never been met with a dish I didn't like!Just next to Piazza delle Erbe, look up and you will notice a whale rib pertruding from the arch that marks the entrance to Piazza dei Signori. The Lodge of Consiglio is the most important building here; a Venetian Renaissance palace unique in Verona, it's neo-classical in design and was built in the second half of the 15th century. The statue of Dante is now in front of us, erected as an initiative of the Academy of Agriculture and the Society of Fine Arts and uncovered on 14 May 1865. Dante wrote a very big part of the Divina Commedia in Verona, but left the city one year before his death.From Piazza dei Signori, it is a one-minute walk to the Arche Scaligere: five impressive Gothic funerary monuments\u00a0that represent the most significant rulers of the city. The most important of these is Cangrande della Scala, an Italian nobleman who was the most celebrated member of the della Scala family, who ruled Verona from 1277 until 1387. Back in those days, Italians traded a lot with Asia, and were very impressed with the knowledge and fine silks of the Asian sovereigns. This is how 'Cangrande' got his name \u2014 after Genghis Khan, 'grande' means big in Italian and 'Khan' was transformed into 'Can.'Next stop is Ponte Pietra, a beautiful Roman arch bridge over the river Adige, and the oldest bridge in Verona. From here one can see the hills surrounding the city and the actual place where the original inhabitants of the city first set-up camp and built their houses. On one side of the river, you'll find the inscription, 'Irene, io e te, tre metri sopra il cielo.' This means 'Irene, you and I, three meters above the clouds,' which comes from a scene in a famous love story by the Italian author Federico Moccia. Having just made love, the girl tells the boy how happy she is, and asks him if he feels the same. He replies: 'No. I am not happy. I am more than that. I am three meters over the sky.' Since its publication, adventurous lovers all over Italy have been writing this message wherever they think it easiest for their better halves to read it; places like bridges and high city walls.Verona\u2019s Roman Theater is considered to be the most important Roman theater in Northern Italy and is the oldest structure in Verona. It was built in the 1st century BC, taking advantage of the natural inclined slope rising from the land beneath the hills, just like the Greeks used to build their terraces before the Romans (flat stage and terraced audience.) Inside the archaeological museum you can admire gorgeous mosaics, Etruscan and Roman sculptures, Greek vases, glass objects, and everyday tools used a long time ago, along with sacred inscriptions and gravestones dating back to the birth of Christ.This restaurant is just above the Roman Theater and can also be reached by car from the center of the city. This is the ideal place for lunch, a sunset dinner, or just a simple drink. A breathtaking view from the panoramic terrace is guaranteed, the service is quick, qualified and efficient, and the food menu and wine list is sure to satisfy every taste. The only problem will be that you will not want to leave!We are now climbing the many steps that take us to Castel San Pietro, but the exercise is well worth it. This is one of my favorite spots in town and the view is just amazing; a magnificent and utterly romantic city viewpoint for a memorable photographic session. Best of all, it is completely free! Remain in awe at the esplanade in front of you and just take in the view.This ancient Roman gate dates back to the 1st century AD and is located very close to the city center, five minutes away from Piazza delle Erbe. It used to be the city\u2019s main entrance and its modern name derives from the word 'bursarii,' which refers to the people who once collected custom duties from anyone who entered the city for commercial purposes. 'Borsa' means \u2018bag\u2019 in Italian and that\u2019s where the bursarii used to put all the money they collected from traders. Talk about Italian bags!Once a military fortification, the Castelvecchio Museum is nowadays one of the most important museums in Verona, housing one of the most exquisite collections of Italian and European art across its 29 rooms. It was restored by the famous Italian architect Carlo Scarpa between 1957 and 1975, and currently boasts an impressive selection of sculptures, paintings, antique weapons, ceramics, old jewelry, and ancient city bells. There is also a more recently constructed part of the museum, called the Napoleonic Wing, which today houses The Museum of Modern Art.Juliet\u2019s Tomb is located in the vaults of the Abbey of San Francesco al Corso, not very far from the Arena di Verona. It is quite an isolated place, as any tomb should be, and dates back to 1937, when Italian artist Antonio Avena decided to give the cloister a new look and dedicated it to the famous Shakespearean heroine.\u00a0In the underground crypt, you can find the red marble tomb without a cover, surrounded by graffiti. There is also a redecorated room in the monastery where weddings can be celebrated on some days of the week. Just outside the tomb\u2019s entrance you will notice a beautiful white statue depicting two characters from one of the most famous Chinese legends: the love story between Liang and Zhu, also known as the 'Far East Romeo and Juliet.'Apart from being an excellent restaurant and osteria, Antica Bottega del Vino is an institution in Verona; its atmosphere simply oozes history, and it's a place where Veronese cuisine comes together with one of the most extensive wine lists in Italy. An illustrious survivor of the hundred osterias that once dotted Verona, La Bottega del Vino offers local specialties to delight the most selective of palettes, and is the only restaurant in Verona to be officially recognized as a 'historic establishment.'"}, {"Salzburg, Austria": "\nIt\u2019s been 200 years or so since he lived here, but Mozart is still very much Salzburg\u2019s favorite son.
